[SOT]CHAPTER I.[SEP]Down the Rabbit-Hole[SEP]Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.[EOT]
[SOT]There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear![SEP]Oh dear![SEP]I shall be late![SEP]” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.[EOT]
[SOT]In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.[EOT]
[SOT]The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.[EOT]
[SOT]Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.[SEP]First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.[SEP]She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well![SEP]” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs![SEP]How brave they’ll all think me at home![SEP]Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house![SEP]” (Which was very likely true.[SEP])[EOT]
[SOT]Down, down, down.[SEP]Would the fall never come to an end?[SEP]“I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?[SEP]” she said aloud.[SEP]“I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.[SEP]Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?[SEP]” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.[SEP])[EOT]
[SOT]Presently she began again.[SEP]“I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth![SEP]How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward![SEP]The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.[SEP]Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?[SEP]” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air![SEP]Do you think you could manage it?[SEP]) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking![SEP]No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Down, down, down.[SEP]There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.[SEP]“Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think![SEP]” (Dinah was the cat.[SEP]) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.[SEP]Dinah my dear![SEP]I wish you were down here with me![SEP]There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know.[SEP]But do cats eat bats, I wonder?[SEP]” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats?[SEP]Do cats eat bats?[SEP]” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?[SEP]” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it.[SEP]She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?[SEP]” when suddenly, thump![SEP]thump![SEP]down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.[SEP]There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting![SEP]” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.[EOT]
[SOT]There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.[EOT]
[SOT]Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas![SEP]either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.[SEP]However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted![EOT]
[SOT]Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.[SEP]How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders.[SEP]Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope![SEP]I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.[SEP]” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.[EOT]
[SOT]There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.[EOT]
[SOT]It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry.[SEP]“No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.[EOT]
[SOT]However, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.[EOT]

[SOT]“What a curious feeling![SEP]” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a telescope.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.[SEP]First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle.[SEP]I wonder what I should be like then?[SEP]” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.[EOT]
[SOT]After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice![SEP]when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come, there’s no use in crying like that![SEP]” said Alice to herself, rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute![SEP]” She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.[SEP]“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people![SEP]Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants.[SEP]“Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way?[SEP]Which way?[SEP]”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.[EOT]
[SOT]So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.[EOT]

[SOT]CHAPTER II.[SEP]The Pool of Tears[SEP]“Curiouser and curiouser![SEP]” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was![SEP]Good-bye, feet![SEP]” (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).[SEP]“Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?[SEP]I’m sure I shan’t be able![SEP]I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go![SEP]Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.[SEP]“They must go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending presents to one’s own feet![SEP]And how odd the directions will look![EOT]
[SOT]Alice’s Right Foot, Esq.[SEP],[SEP]Hearthrug,[SEP]near the Fender,[SEP](with Alice’s love).[SEP]Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.[EOT]
[SOT]Poor Alice![SEP]It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.[EOT]
[SOT]“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way![SEP]Stop this moment, I tell you![SEP]” But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.[EOT]
[SOT]After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.[SEP]It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh![SEP]the Duchess, the Duchess![SEP]Oh![SEP]won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting![SEP]” Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear![SEP]How queer everything is to-day![SEP]And yesterday things went on just as usual.[SEP]I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night?[SEP]Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning?[SEP]I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.[SEP]But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I?[SEP]Ah, that’s the great puzzle![SEP]” And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh![SEP]she knows such a very little![SEP]Besides, she’s she, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is![SEP]I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.[SEP]Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear![SEP]I shall never get to twenty at that rate![SEP]However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try Geography.[SEP]London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I’m certain![SEP]I must have been changed for Mabel![SEP]I’ll try and say ‘How doth the little—’” and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:—[EOT]
[SOT]“How doth the little crocodile[SEP]Improve his shining tail,[SEP]And pour the waters of the Nile[SEP]On every golden scale![EOT]
[SOT]“How cheerfully he seems to grin,[SEP]How neatly spread his claws,[SEP]And welcome little fishes in[SEP]With gently smiling jaws![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh![SEP]ever so many lessons to learn![SEP]No, I’ve made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here![SEP]It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear![SEP]’ I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then?[SEP]Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear![SEP]” cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, “I do wish they would put their heads down![SEP]I am so very tired of being all alone here![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while she was talking.[SEP]“How can I have done that?[SEP]” she thought.[SEP]“I must be growing small again.[SEP]” She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.[EOT]
[SOT]“That was a narrow escape![SEP]” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and now for the garden![SEP]” and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas![SEP]the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this before, never![SEP]And I declare it’s too bad, that it is![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash![SEP]she was up to her chin in salt water.[SEP]Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by railway,” she said to herself.[SEP](Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.[SEP]) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.[EOT]
[SOT]“I wish I hadn’t cried so much![SEP]” said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out.[SEP]“I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears![SEP]That will be a queer thing, to be sure![SEP]However, everything is queer to-day.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.[EOT]
[SOT]“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?[SEP]Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.[SEP]” So she began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?[SEP]I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse![SEP]” (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse![SEP]”) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.[EOT]
[SOT]“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.[SEP]” (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.[SEP]) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?[SEP]” which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.[SEP]The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.[SEP]“Oh, I beg your pardon![SEP]” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal’s feelings.[SEP]“I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Not like cats![SEP]” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.[SEP]“Would you like cats if you were me?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry about it.[SEP]And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.[SEP]She is such a dear quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon![SEP]” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.[SEP]“We won’t talk about her any more if you’d rather not.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“We indeed![SEP]” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail.[SEP]“As if I would talk on such a subject![SEP]Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things![SEP]Don’t let me hear the name again![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I won’t indeed![SEP]” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation.[SEP]“Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?[SEP]” The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you![SEP]A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair![SEP]And it’ll fetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds![SEP]He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear![SEP]” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again![SEP]” For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.[EOT]
[SOT]So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear![SEP]Do come back again, and we won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them![SEP]” When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.[SEP]Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER III.[SEP]A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale[SEP]They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.[EOT]
[SOT]The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.[SEP]Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.[EOT]
[SOT]At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me![SEP]I’ll soon make you dry enough![SEP]” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.[SEP]Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ahem![SEP]” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready?[SEP]This is the driest thing I know.[SEP]Silence all round, if you please![SEP]‘William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.[SEP]Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—’”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ugh![SEP]” said the Lory, with a shiver.[EOT]
[SOT]“I beg your pardon![SEP]” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did you speak?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Not I![SEP]” said the Lory hastily.[EOT]
[SOT]“I thought you did,” said the Mouse.[SEP]“—I proceed.[SEP]‘Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”[EOT]
[SOT]“Found what?[SEP]” said the Duck.[EOT]
[SOT]“Found it,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know what ‘it’ means.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when I find a thing,” said the Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm.[SEP]The question is, what did the archbishop find?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.[SEP]William’s conduct at first was moderate.[SEP]But the insolence of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?[SEP]” it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.[EOT]
[SOT]“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to dry me at all.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—”[EOT]
[SOT]“Speak English![SEP]” said the Eaglet.[SEP]“I don’t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either![SEP]” And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.[EOT]
[SOT]“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What is a Caucus-race?[SEP]” said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.[SEP]” (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.[SEP])[EOT]
[SOT]First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there.[SEP]There was no “One, two, three, and away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.[SEP]However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over![SEP]” and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.[SEP]At last the Dodo said, “Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But who is to give the prizes?[SEP]” quite a chorus of voices asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why, she, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, “Prizes![SEP]Prizes![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.[SEP]There was exactly one a-piece, all round.[EOT]
[SOT]“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely.[SEP]“What else have you got in your pocket?[SEP]” he went on, turning to Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.[EOT]
[SOT]“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.[EOT]
[SOT]Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.[EOT]
[SOT]The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.[SEP]However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.[EOT]
[SOT]“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.[EOT]
[SOT]“Mine is a long and a sad tale![SEP]” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.[EOT]
[SOT]“It is a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?[SEP]” And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:—[EOT]
[SOT]“Fury said to a[SEP]mouse, That he[SEP]met in the[SEP]house,[SEP]‘Let us[SEP]both go to[SEP]law: I will[SEP]prosecute[SEP]you.[SEP]—Come,[SEP]I’ll take no[SEP]denial; We[SEP]must have a[SEP]trial: For[SEP]really this[SEP]morning I’ve[SEP]nothing[SEP]to do.[SEP]’[SEP]Said the[SEP]mouse to the[SEP]cur, ‘Such[SEP]a trial,[SEP]dear sir,[SEP]With[SEP]no jury[SEP]or judge,[SEP]would be[SEP]wasting[SEP]our[SEP]breath.[SEP]’[SEP]‘I’ll be[SEP]judge, I’ll[SEP]be jury,’[SEP]Said[SEP]cunning[SEP]old Fury:[SEP]‘I’ll[SEP]try the[SEP]whole[SEP]cause,[SEP]and[SEP]condemn[SEP]you[SEP]to[SEP]death.[SEP]’”[SEP]“You are not attending![SEP]” said the Mouse to Alice severely.[SEP]“What are you thinking of?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth bend, I think?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I had not![SEP]” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.[EOT]
[SOT]“A knot![SEP]” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her.[SEP]“Oh, do let me help to undo it![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and walking away.[SEP]“You insult me by talking such nonsense![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I didn’t mean it![SEP]” pleaded poor Alice.[SEP]“But you’re so easily offended, you know![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Mouse only growled in reply.[EOT]
[SOT]“Please come back and finish your story![SEP]” Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do![SEP]” but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.[EOT]
[SOT]“What a pity it wouldn’t stay![SEP]” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter “Ah, my dear![SEP]Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper![SEP]” “Hold your tongue, Ma![SEP]” said the young Crab, a little snappishly.[SEP]“You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do![SEP]” said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular.[SEP]“She’d soon fetch it back![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?[SEP]” said the Lory.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: “Dinah’s our cat.[SEP]And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you can’t think![SEP]And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds![SEP]Why, she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.[SEP]Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn’t suit my throat![SEP]” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, “Come away, my dears![SEP]It’s high time you were all in bed![SEP]” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.[EOT]
[SOT]“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah![SEP]” she said to herself in a melancholy tone.[SEP]“Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best cat in the world![SEP]Oh, my dear Dinah![SEP]I wonder if I shall ever see you any more![SEP]” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.[SEP]In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER IV.[SEP]The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill[SEP]It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself “The Duchess![SEP]The Duchess![SEP]Oh my dear paws![SEP]Oh my fur and whiskers![SEP]She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets![SEP]Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?[SEP]” Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.[EOT]
[SOT]Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here?[SEP]Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan![SEP]Quick, now![SEP]” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.[EOT]
[SOT]“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran.[SEP]“How surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am![SEP]But I’d better take him his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.[SEP]” As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name “W.[SEP]RABBIT,” engraved upon it.[SEP]She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.[EOT]
[SOT]“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for a rabbit![SEP]I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next![SEP]” And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice![SEP]Come here directly, and get ready for your walk![SEP]’ ‘Coming in a minute, nurse![SEP]But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.[SEP]’ Only I don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass.[SEP]There was no label this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.[SEP]“I know something interesting is sure to happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so I’ll just see what this bottle does.[SEP]I do hope it’ll make me grow large again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.[SEP]She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alas![SEP]it was too late to wish that![SEP]She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.[SEP]Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I can do no more, whatever happens.[SEP]What will become of me?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.[EOT]
[SOT]“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits.[SEP]I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life![SEP]I do wonder what can have happened to me![SEP]When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one![SEP]There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought![SEP]And when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more here.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I never get any older than I am now?[SEP]That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn![SEP]Oh, I shouldn’t like that![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, you foolish Alice![SEP]” she answered herself.[SEP]“How can you learn lessons in here?[SEP]Why, there’s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.[EOT]
[SOT]“Mary Ann![SEP]Mary Ann![SEP]” said the voice.[SEP]“Fetch me my gloves this moment![SEP]” Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs.[SEP]Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.[EOT]
[SOT]Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.[SEP]Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll go round and get in at the window.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That you won’t![SEP]” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.[SEP]She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.[EOT]
[SOT]Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat![SEP]Pat![SEP]Where are you?[SEP]” And then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here![SEP]Digging for apples, yer honour![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Digging for apples, indeed![SEP]” said the Rabbit angrily.[SEP]“Here![SEP]Come and help me out of this![SEP]” (Sounds of more broken glass.[SEP])[EOT]
[SOT]“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour![SEP]” (He pronounced it “arrum.[SEP]”)[EOT]
[SOT]“An arm, you goose![SEP]Who ever saw one that size?[SEP]Why, it fills the whole window![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at all![SEP]” “Do as I tell you, you coward![SEP]” and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air.[SEP]This time there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass.[SEP]“What a number of cucumber-frames there must be![SEP]” thought Alice.[SEP]“I wonder what they’ll do next![SEP]As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could![SEP]I’m sure I don’t want to stay in here any longer![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other ladder?[SEP]—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill![SEP]fetch it here, lad![SEP]—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh![SEP]they’ll do well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill![SEP]catch hold of this rope—Will the roof bear?[SEP]—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down![SEP]Heads below![SEP]” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?[SEP]—It was Bill, I fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?[SEP]—Nay, I shan’t![SEP]You do it![SEP]—That I won’t, then![SEP]—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill![SEP]the master says you’re to go down the chimney![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh![SEP]So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?[SEP]” said Alice to herself.[SEP]“Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill![SEP]I wouldn’t be in Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.[EOT]
[SOT]The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill![SEP]” then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge![SEP]” then silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow?[SEP]What happened to you?[SEP]Tell us all about it![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“So you did, old fellow![SEP]” said the others.[EOT]
[SOT]“We must burn the house down![SEP]” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I wonder what they will do next![SEP]If they had any sense, they’d take the roof off.[SEP]” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“A barrowful of what?[SEP]” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.[SEP]“I’ll put a stop to this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that again![SEP]” which produced another dead silence.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head.[SEP]“If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly.[SEP]As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.[SEP]The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.[SEP]They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.[EOT]
[SOT]“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.[SEP]I think that will be the best plan.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.[EOT]
[SOT]An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.[SEP]“Poor little thing![SEP]” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.[EOT]
[SOT]Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.[EOT]
[SOT]This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.[EOT]
[SOT]“And yet what a dear little puppy it was![SEP]” said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d only been the right size to do it![SEP]Oh dear![SEP]I’d nearly forgotten that I’ve got to grow up again![SEP]Let me see—how is it to be managed?[SEP]I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The great question certainly was, what?[SEP]Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.[SEP]There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.[EOT]
[SOT]She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER V.[SEP]Advice from a Caterpillar[SEP]The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Who are you?[SEP]” said the Caterpillar.[EOT]
[SOT]This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.[SEP]Alice replied, rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What do you mean by that?[SEP]” said the Caterpillar sternly.[SEP]“Explain yourself![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I can’t explain myself, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m not myself, you see.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely, “for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little queer, won’t you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know is, it would feel very queer to me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You![SEP]” said the Caterpillar contemptuously.[SEP]“Who are you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.[SEP]Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why?[SEP]” said the Caterpillar.[EOT]
[SOT]Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come back![SEP]” the Caterpillar called after her.[SEP]“I’ve something important to say![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.[EOT]
[SOT]“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.[EOT]
[SOT]“Is that all?[SEP]” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.[EOT]
[SOT]“No,” said the Caterpillar.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.[SEP]For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you think you’re changed, do you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Can’t remember what things?[SEP]” said the Caterpillar.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all came different![SEP]” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Repeat, ‘You are old, Father William,’” said the Caterpillar.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice folded her hands, and began:—[EOT]
[SOT]“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,[SEP]“And your hair has become very white;[SEP]And yet you incessantly stand on your head—[SEP]Do you think, at your age, it is right?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,[SEP]“I feared it might injure the brain;[SEP]But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,[SEP]Why, I do it again and again.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,[SEP]And have grown most uncommonly fat;[SEP]Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—[SEP]Pray, what is the reason of that?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,[SEP]“I kept all my limbs very supple[SEP]By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—[SEP]Allow me to sell you a couple?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak[SEP]For anything tougher than suet;[SEP]Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—[SEP]Pray, how did you manage to do it?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,[SEP]And argued each case with my wife;[SEP]And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,[SEP]Has lasted the rest of my life.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose[SEP]That your eye was as steady as ever;[SEP]Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—[SEP]What made you so awfully clever?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”[SEP]Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs![SEP]Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?[SEP]Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.[EOT]
[SOT]“Not quite right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the words have got altered.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.[EOT]
[SOT]The Caterpillar was the first to speak.[EOT]
[SOT]“What size do you want to be?[SEP]” it asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one doesn’t like changing so often, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t know,” said the Caterpillar.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.[EOT]
[SOT]“Are you content now?[SEP]” said the Caterpillar.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn’t mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It is a very good height indeed![SEP]” said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).[EOT]
[SOT]“But I’m not used to it![SEP]” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.[SEP]And she thought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily offended![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.[EOT]
[SOT]This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.[SEP]In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.[SEP]Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, “One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“One side of what?[SEP]The other side of what?[SEP]” thought Alice to herself.[EOT]
[SOT]“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.[SEP]However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“And now which is which?[SEP]” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot![EOT]
[SOT]She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.[SEP]Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.[EOT]
[SOT]*      *      *      *      *      *      *[EOT]
[SOT]*      *      *      *      *      *[EOT]
[SOT]*      *      *      *      *      *      *[EOT]
[SOT]“Come, my head’s free at last![SEP]” said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.[EOT]
[SOT]“What can all that green stuff be?[SEP]” said Alice.[SEP]“And where have my shoulders got to?[SEP]And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?[SEP]” She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.[EOT]
[SOT]As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.[SEP]She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.[EOT]
[SOT]“Serpent![SEP]” screamed the Pigeon.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m not a serpent![SEP]” said Alice indignantly.[SEP]“Let me alone![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Serpent, I say again![SEP]” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those serpents![SEP]There’s no pleasing them![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.[EOT]
[SOT]“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon; “but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day![SEP]Why, I haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.[EOT]
[SOT]“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky![SEP]Ugh, Serpent![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But I’m not a serpent, I tell you![SEP]” said Alice.[SEP]“I’m a—I’m a—”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well![SEP]What are you?[SEP]” said the Pigeon.[SEP]“I can see you’re trying to invent something![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.[EOT]
[SOT]“A likely story indeed![SEP]” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt.[SEP]“I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that![SEP]No, no![SEP]You’re a serpent; and there’s no use denying it.[SEP]I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I have tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It matters a good deal to me,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want yours: I don’t like them raw.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, be off, then![SEP]” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest.[SEP]Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it.[SEP]After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.[EOT]
[SOT]It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.[SEP]“Come, there’s half my plan done now![SEP]How puzzling all these changes are![SEP]I’m never sure what I’m going to be, from one minute to another![SEP]However, I’ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done, I wonder?[SEP]” As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.[SEP]“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits![SEP]” So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER VI.[SEP]Pig and Pepper[SEP]For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.[SEP]It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.[SEP]She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.[EOT]
[SOT]The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess.[SEP]An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.[SEP]” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.[SEP]An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.[EOT]
[SOT]“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for two reasons.[SEP]First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.[SEP]” And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.[EOT]
[SOT]“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on without attending to her, “if we had the door between us.[SEP]For instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.[SEP]” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.[SEP]“But perhaps he can’t help it,” she said to herself; “his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head.[SEP]But at any rate he might answer questions.[SEP]—How am I to get in?[SEP]” she repeated, aloud.[EOT]
[SOT]“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”[EOT]
[SOT]At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.[EOT]
[SOT]“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.[EOT]
[SOT]“How am I to get in?[SEP]” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.[EOT]
[SOT]“Are you to get in at all?[SEP]” said the Footman.[SEP]“That’s the first question, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.[SEP]“It’s really dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.[SEP]It’s enough to drive one crazy![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations.[SEP]“I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for days and days.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But what am I to do?[SEP]” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s perfectly idiotic![SEP]” And she opened the door and went in.[EOT]
[SOT]The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.[EOT]
[SOT]“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup![SEP]” Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.[EOT]
[SOT]There was certainly too much of it in the air.[SEP]Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment’s pause.[SEP]The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.[EOT]
[SOT]“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why your cat grins like that?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why.[SEP]Pig![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—[EOT]
[SOT]“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know that cats could grin.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.[EOT]
[SOT]“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.[SEP]While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.[SEP]The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, please mind what you’re doing![SEP]” cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror.[SEP]“Oh, there goes his precious nose![SEP]” as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.[EOT]
[SOT]“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Which would not be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.[SEP]“Just think of what work it would make with the day and night![SEP]You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”[EOT]
[SOT]“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I think; or is it twelve?[SEP]I—”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, don’t bother me,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide figures![SEP]” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:[EOT]
[SOT]“Speak roughly to your little boy,[SEP]And beat him when he sneezes:[SEP]He only does it to annoy,[SEP]Because he knows it teases.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]CHORUS.[SEP](In which the cook and the baby joined):[EOT]
[SOT]“Wow![SEP]wow![SEP]wow![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:—[EOT]
[SOT]“I speak severely to my boy,[SEP]I beat him when he sneezes;[SEP]For he can thoroughly enjoy[SEP]The pepper when he pleases![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Wow![SEP]wow![SEP]wow![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Here![SEP]you may nurse it a bit, if you like![SEP]” the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.[SEP]“I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room.[SEP]The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, “just like a star-fish,” thought Alice.[SEP]The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.[EOT]
[SOT]As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.[SEP]“If I don’t take this child away with me,” thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be murder to leave it behind?[SEP]” She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).[SEP]“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it.[SEP]There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all.[SEP]“But perhaps it was only sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.[EOT]
[SOT]No, there were no tears.[SEP]“If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,” said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you.[SEP]Mind now![SEP]” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?[SEP]” when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.[SEP]This time there could be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.[EOT]
[SOT]So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood.[SEP]“If it had grown up,” she said to herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.[SEP]” And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.[EOT]
[SOT]The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.[SEP]It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.[EOT]
[SOT]“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.[SEP]“Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.[SEP]“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.[EOT]
[SOT]“—so long as I get somewhere,” Alice added as an explanation.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.[SEP]“What sort of people live about here?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“In that direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a Hatter: and in that direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March Hare.[SEP]Visit either you like: they’re both mad.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here.[SEP]I’m mad.[SEP]You’re mad.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“How do you know I’m mad?[SEP]” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how do you know that you’re mad?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad.[SEP]You grant that?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I suppose so,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry, and wags its tail when it’s pleased.[SEP]Now I growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry.[SEP]Therefore I’m mad.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Call it what you like,” said the Cat.[SEP]“Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited yet.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening.[SEP]While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.[EOT]
[SOT]“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?[SEP]” said the Cat.[SEP]“I’d nearly forgotten to ask.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.[EOT]
[SOT]“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live.[SEP]“I’ve seen hatters before,” she said to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March.[SEP]” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.[EOT]
[SOT]“Did you say pig, or fig?[SEP]” said the Cat.[EOT]
[SOT]“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well![SEP]I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a grin without a cat![SEP]It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur.[SEP]It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all![SEP]I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER VII.[SEP]A Mad Tea-Party[SEP]There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.[SEP]“Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: “No room![SEP]No room![SEP]” they cried out when they saw Alice coming.[SEP]“There’s plenty of room![SEP]” said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.[EOT]
[SOT]“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.[SEP]“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.[EOT]
[SOT]“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.[EOT]
[SOT]“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said the March Hare.[EOT]
[SOT]“I didn’t know it was your table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great many more than three.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter.[SEP]He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.[EOT]
[SOT]“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some severity; “it’s very rude.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Come, we shall have some fun now![SEP]” thought Alice.[SEP]“I’m glad they’ve begun asking riddles.[SEP]—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.[EOT]
[SOT]“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?[SEP]” said the March Hare.[EOT]
[SOT]“Exactly so,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.[EOT]
[SOT]“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I say—that’s the same thing, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Not the same thing a bit![SEP]” said the Hatter.[SEP]“You might just as well say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing as ‘I sleep when I breathe’![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It is the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn’t much.[EOT]
[SOT]The Hatter was the first to break the silence.[SEP]“What day of the month is it?[SEP]” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Two days wrong![SEP]” sighed the Hatter.[SEP]“I told you butter wouldn’t suit the works![SEP]” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.[EOT]
[SOT]“It was the best butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled: “you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the best butter, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.[SEP]“What a funny watch![SEP]” she remarked.[SEP]“It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t tell what o’clock it is![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why should it?[SEP]” muttered the Hatter.[SEP]“Does your watch tell you what year it is?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Which is just the case with mine,” said the Hatter.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.[SEP]“I don’t quite understand you,” she said, as politely as she could.[EOT]
[SOT]“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.[EOT]
[SOT]The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Have you guessed the riddle yet?[SEP]” the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.[EOT]
[SOT]“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.[EOT]
[SOT]“Nor I,” said the March Hare.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice sighed wearily.[SEP]“I think you might do something better with the time,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk about wasting it.[SEP]It’s him.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course you don’t![SEP]” the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.[SEP]“I dare say you never even spoke to Time![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah![SEP]that accounts for it,” said the Hatter.[SEP]“He won’t stand beating.[SEP]Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything you liked with the clock.[SEP]For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling![SEP]Half-past one, time for dinner![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT](“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.[SEP])[EOT]
[SOT]“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Is that the way you manage?[SEP]” Alice asked.[EOT]
[SOT]The Hatter shook his head mournfully.[SEP]“Not I![SEP]” he replied.[SEP]“We quarrelled last March—just before he went mad, you know—” (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing[EOT]
[SOT]‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat![SEP]How I wonder what you’re at![SEP]’[EOT]
[SOT]You know the song, perhaps?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—[EOT]
[SOT]‘Up above the world you fly,[SEP]Like a tea-tray in the sky.[SEP]Twinkle, twinkle—’”[EOT]
[SOT]Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep “Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle—” and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time![SEP]Off with his head![SEP]’”[EOT]
[SOT]“How dreadfully savage![SEP]” exclaimed Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t do a thing I ask![SEP]It’s always six o’clock now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]A bright idea came into Alice’s head.[SEP]“Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?[SEP]” she asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time, and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?[SEP]” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?[SEP]” Alice ventured to ask.[EOT]
[SOT]“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.[SEP]“I’m getting tired of this.[SEP]I vote the young lady tells us a story.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then the Dormouse shall![SEP]” they both cried.[SEP]“Wake up, Dormouse![SEP]” And they pinched it on both sides at once.[EOT]
[SOT]The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.[SEP]“I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Tell us a story![SEP]” said the March Hare.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, please do![SEP]” pleaded Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again before it’s done.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began in a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well—”[EOT]
[SOT]“What did they live on?[SEP]” said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.[EOT]
[SOT]“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.[SEP]“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked; “they’d have been ill.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “very ill.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But why did they live at the bottom of a well?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t take more.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You mean you can’t take less,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to take more than nothing.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Nobody asked your opinion,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Who’s making personal remarks now?[SEP]” the Hatter asked triumphantly.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question.[SEP]“Why did they live at the bottom of a well?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, “It was a treacle-well.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“There’s no such thing![SEP]” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went “Sh![SEP]sh![SEP]” and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for yourself.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No, please go on![SEP]” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again.[SEP]I dare say there may be one.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“One, indeed![SEP]” said the Dormouse indignantly.[SEP]However, he consented to go on.[SEP]“And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw, you know—”[EOT]
[SOT]“What did they draw?[SEP]” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.[EOT]
[SOT]“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.[EOT]
[SOT]“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place on.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.[SEP]The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: “But I don’t understand.[SEP]Where did they draw the treacle from?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But they were in the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.[EOT]
[SOT]“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of things—everything that begins with an M—”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why with an M?[SEP]” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why not?[SEP]” said the March Hare.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice was silent.[EOT]
[SOT]The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t think—”[EOT]
[SOT]“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.[EOT]
[SOT]This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.[EOT]
[SOT]“At any rate I’ll never go there again![SEP]” said Alice as she picked her way through the wood.[SEP]“It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it.[SEP]“That’s very curious![SEP]” she thought.[SEP]“But everything’s curious today.[SEP]I think I may as well go in at once.[SEP]” And in she went.[EOT]
[SOT]Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table.[SEP]“Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden.[SEP]Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and then—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER VIII.[SEP]The Queen’s Croquet-Ground[SEP]A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red.[SEP]Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, “Look out now, Five![SEP]Don’t go splashing paint over me like that![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my elbow.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five![SEP]Always lay the blame on others![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You’d better not talk![SEP]” said Five.[SEP]“I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What for?[SEP]” said the one who had spoken first.[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s none of your business, Two![SEP]” said Seven.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, it is his business![SEP]” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.[EOT]
[SOT]“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are painting those roses?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.[SEP]Two began in a low voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.[SEP]So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out “The Queen![SEP]The Queen![SEP]” and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces.[SEP]There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.[EOT]
[SOT]First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did.[SEP]After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts.[SEP]Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her.[SEP]Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?[SEP]” So she stood still where she was, and waited.[EOT]
[SOT]When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?[SEP]” She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.[EOT]
[SOT]“Idiot![SEP]” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after all.[SEP]I needn’t be afraid of them![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And who are these?[SEP]” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.[EOT]
[SOT]“How should I know?[SEP]” said Alice, surprised at her own courage.[SEP]“It’s no business of mine.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head![SEP]Off—”[EOT]
[SOT]“Nonsense![SEP]” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.[EOT]
[SOT]The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my dear: she is only a child![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn them over![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.[EOT]
[SOT]“Get up![SEP]” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.[EOT]
[SOT]“Leave off that![SEP]” screamed the Queen.[SEP]“You make me giddy.[SEP]” And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What have you been doing here?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”[EOT]
[SOT]“I see![SEP]” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.[SEP]“Off with their heads![SEP]” and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.[EOT]
[SOT]“You shan’t be beheaded![SEP]” said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near.[SEP]The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.[EOT]
[SOT]“Are their heads off?[SEP]” shouted the Queen.[EOT]
[SOT]“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty![SEP]” the soldiers shouted in reply.[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s right![SEP]” shouted the Queen.[SEP]“Can you play croquet?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes![SEP]” shouted Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come on, then![SEP]” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s—it’s a very fine day![SEP]” said a timid voice at her side.[SEP]She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.[EOT]
[SOT]“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Hush![SEP]Hush![SEP]” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.[SEP]He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under sentence of execution.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What for?[SEP]” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Did you say ‘What a pity![SEP]’?[SEP]” the Rabbit asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity.[SEP]I said ‘What for?[SEP]’”[EOT]
[SOT]“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began.[SEP]Alice gave a little scream of laughter.[SEP]“Oh, hush![SEP]” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone.[SEP]“The Queen will hear you![SEP]You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said—”[EOT]
[SOT]“Get to your places![SEP]” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began.[SEP]Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.[EOT]
[SOT]The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.[EOT]
[SOT]The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting “Off with his head![SEP]” or “Off with her head![SEP]” about once in a minute.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, “and then,” thought she, “what would become of me?[SEP]They’re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any one left alive![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“How are you getting on?[SEP]” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.[SEP]“It’s no use speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one of them.[SEP]” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.[SEP]The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“How do you like the Queen?[SEP]” said the Cat in a low voice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, “—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Queen smiled and passed on.[EOT]
[SOT]“Who are you talking to?[SEP]” said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to introduce it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like that![SEP]” He got behind Alice as he spoke.[EOT]
[SOT]“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice.[SEP]“I’ve read that in some book, but I don’t remember where.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear![SEP]I wish you would have this cat removed![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.[SEP]“Off with his head![SEP]” she said, without even looking round.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with passion.[SEP]She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not.[SEP]So she went in search of her hedgehog.[EOT]
[SOT]The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.[EOT]
[SOT]By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.[SEP]” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.[EOT]
[SOT]When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.[EOT]
[SOT]The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.[EOT]
[SOT]The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of life.[EOT]
[SOT]The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.[EOT]
[SOT]The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round.[SEP](It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.[SEP])[EOT]
[SOT]Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the Duchess: you’d better ask her about it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.[SEP]” And the executioner went off like an arrow.[EOT]
[SOT]The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER IX.[SEP]The Mock Turtle’s Story[SEP]“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing![SEP]” said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s, and they walked off together.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.[EOT]
[SOT]“When I’m a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen at all.[SEP]Soup does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered.[SEP]I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn’t be so stingy about it, you know—”[EOT]
[SOT]She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.[SEP]“You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.[SEP]I can’t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.[EOT]
[SOT]“Tut, tut, child![SEP]” said the Duchess.[SEP]“Everything’s got a moral, if only you can find it.[SEP]” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as she spoke.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was very ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.[SEP]However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.[EOT]
[SOT]“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.[EOT]
[SOT]“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love, ’tis love, that makes the world go round![SEP]’”[EOT]
[SOT]“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding their own business![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah, well![SEP]It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of that is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.[SEP]’”[EOT]
[SOT]“How fond she is of finding morals in things![SEP]” Alice thought to herself.[EOT]
[SOT]“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,” the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.[SEP]Shall I try the experiment?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.[EOT]
[SOT]“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite.[SEP]And the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.[SEP]’”[EOT]
[SOT]“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of putting things![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s a mineral, I think,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.[SEP]And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.[SEP]’”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, I know![SEP]” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, “it’s a vegetable.[SEP]It doesn’t look like one, but it is.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.[SEP]’”[EOT]
[SOT]“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely, “if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.[EOT]
[SOT]“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, don’t talk about trouble![SEP]” said the Duchess.[SEP]“I make you a present of everything I’ve said as yet.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“A cheap sort of present![SEP]” thought Alice.[SEP]“I’m glad they don’t give birthday presents like that![SEP]” But she did not venture to say it out loud.[EOT]
[SOT]“Thinking again?[SEP]” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.[EOT]
[SOT]“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and the m—”[EOT]
[SOT]But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.[SEP]Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.[EOT]
[SOT]“A fine day, your Majesty![SEP]” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time![SEP]Take your choice![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.[EOT]
[SOT]“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.[EOT]
[SOT]The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay would cost them their lives.[EOT]
[SOT]All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head![SEP]” or “Off with her head![SEP]” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.[EOT]
[SOT]Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No,” said Alice.[SEP]“I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.[EOT]
[SOT]“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.[SEP]” “Come, that’s a good thing![SEP]” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.[EOT]
[SOT]They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.[SEP](If you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.[SEP]) “Up, lazy thing![SEP]” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.[SEP]I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.[SEP]Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.[EOT]
[SOT]The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled.[SEP]“What fun![SEP]” said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“What is the fun?[SEP]” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why, she,” said the Gryphon.[SEP]“It’s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know.[SEP]Come on![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Everybody says ‘come on![SEP]’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.[SEP]She pitied him deeply.[SEP]“What is his sorrow?[SEP]” she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know.[SEP]Come on![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.[EOT]
[SOT]“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your history, she do.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.[SEP]Alice thought to herself, “I don’t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn’t begin.[SEP]” But she waited patiently.[EOT]
[SOT]“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real Turtle.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh![SEP]” from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.[SEP]Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.[EOT]
[SOT]“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the sea.[SEP]The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?[SEP]” Alice asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle angrily: “really you are very dull![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.[SEP]At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow![SEP]Don’t be all day about it![SEP]” and he went on in these words:[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”[EOT]
[SOT]“I never said I didn’t![SEP]” interrupted Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.[EOT]
[SOT]“Hold your tongue![SEP]” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.[SEP]The Mock Turtle went on.[EOT]
[SOT]“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ve been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so proud as all that.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“With extras?[SEP]” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And washing?[SEP]” said the Mock Turtle.[EOT]
[SOT]“Certainly not![SEP]” said Alice indignantly.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah![SEP]then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief.[SEP]“Now at ours they had at the end of the bill, ‘French, music, and washing—extra.[SEP]’”[EOT]
[SOT]“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom of the sea.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I couldn’t afford to learn it.[SEP]” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh.[SEP]“I only took the regular course.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What was that?[SEP]” inquired Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say.[SEP]“What is it?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.[SEP]“What![SEP]Never heard of uglifying![SEP]” it exclaimed.[SEP]“You know what to beautify is, I suppose?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: he taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What was that like?[SEP]” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too stiff.[SEP]And the Gryphon never learnt it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master, though.[SEP]He was an old crab, he was.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.[EOT]
[SOT]“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?[SEP]” said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so on.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What a curious plan![SEP]” exclaimed Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked: “because they lessen from day to day.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark.[SEP]“Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.[EOT]
[SOT]“And how did you manage on the twelfth?[SEP]” Alice went on eagerly.[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER X.[SEP]The Lobster Quadrille[SEP]The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes.[SEP]He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice.[SEP]“Same as if he had a bone in his throat,” said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back.[SEP]At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:—[EOT]
[SOT]“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said Alice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—” (Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No, indeed,” said Alice.[SEP]“What sort of a dance is it?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the sea-shore—”[EOT]
[SOT]“Two lines![SEP]” cried the Mock Turtle.[SEP]“Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”[EOT]
[SOT]“That generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.[EOT]
[SOT]“—you advance twice—”[EOT]
[SOT]“Each with a lobster as a partner![SEP]” cried the Gryphon.[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”[EOT]
[SOT]“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”[EOT]
[SOT]“The lobsters![SEP]” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.[EOT]
[SOT]“—as far out to sea as you can—”[EOT]
[SOT]“Swim after them![SEP]” screamed the Gryphon.[EOT]
[SOT]“Turn a somersault in the sea![SEP]” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.[EOT]
[SOT]“Change lobsters again![SEP]” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.[EOT]
[SOT]“Would you like to see a little of it?[SEP]” said the Mock Turtle.[EOT]
[SOT]“Very much indeed,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come, let’s try the first figure![SEP]” said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.[SEP]“We can do without lobsters, you know.[SEP]Which shall sing?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, you sing,” said the Gryphon.[SEP]“I’ve forgotten the words.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:—[EOT]
[SOT]“Will you walk a little faster?[SEP]” said a whiting to a snail.[SEP]“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.[SEP]See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance![SEP]They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?[SEP]Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?[SEP]Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?[EOT]
[SOT]“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be[SEP]When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea![SEP]”[SEP]But the snail replied “Too far, too far![SEP]” and gave a look askance—[SEP]Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.[SEP]Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.[SEP]Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.[EOT]
[SOT]“What matters it how far we go?[SEP]” his scaly friend replied.[SEP]“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.[SEP]The further off from England the nearer is to France—[SEP]Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.[SEP]Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?[SEP]Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that curious song about the whiting![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them, of course?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself hastily.[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully.[SEP]“They have their tails in their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would all wash off in the sea.[SEP]But they have their tails in their mouths; and the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.[SEP]—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.[EOT]
[SOT]“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they would go with the lobsters to the dance.[SEP]So they got thrown out to sea.[SEP]So they had to fall a long way.[SEP]So they got their tails fast in their mouths.[SEP]So they couldn’t get them out again.[SEP]That’s all.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting.[SEP]I never knew so much about a whiting before.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon.[SEP]“Do you know why it’s called a whiting?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I never thought about it,” said Alice.[SEP]“Why?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It does the boots and shoes,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice was thoroughly puzzled.[SEP]“Does the boots and shoes![SEP]” she repeated in a wondering tone.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why, what are your shoes done with?[SEP]” said the Gryphon.[SEP]“I mean, what makes them so shiny?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer.[SEP]“They’re done with blacking, I believe.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, “are done with a whiting.[SEP]Now you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And what are they made of?[SEP]” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.[EOT]
[SOT]“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: “any shrimp could have told you that.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back, please: we don’t want you with us![SEP]’”[EOT]
[SOT]“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Wouldn’t it really?[SEP]” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to me, and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?[SEP]’”[EOT]
[SOT]“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?[SEP]” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.[SEP]And the Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of your adventures.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.[EOT]
[SOT]“No, no![SEP]The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: “explanations take such a dreadful time.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit.[SEP]She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on.[SEP]Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating “You are old, Father William,” to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.[EOT]
[SOT]“It all came different![SEP]” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.[SEP]“I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.[SEP]Tell her to begin.[SEP]” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Stand up and repeat ‘’Tis the voice of the sluggard,’” said the Gryphon.[EOT]
[SOT]“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons![SEP]” thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.[SEP]” However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:—[EOT]
[SOT]“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,[SEP]“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.[SEP]”[SEP]As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose[SEP]Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT][later editions continued as follows[SEP]When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,[SEP]And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,[SEP]But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,[SEP]His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.[SEP]][EOT]
[SOT]“That’s different from what I used to say when I was a child,” said the Gryphon.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds uncommon nonsense.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again.[EOT]
[SOT]“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.[EOT]
[SOT]“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily.[SEP]“Go on with the next verse.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But about his toes?[SEP]” the Mock Turtle persisted.[SEP]“How could he turn them out with his nose, you know?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s the first position in dancing.[SEP]” Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.[EOT]
[SOT]“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it begins ‘I passed by his garden.[SEP]’”[EOT]
[SOT]Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—[EOT]
[SOT]“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,[SEP]How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”[EOT]
[SOT][later editions continued as follows[SEP]The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,[SEP]While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.[SEP]When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,[SEP]Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:[SEP]While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,[SEP]And concluded the banquet—][EOT]
[SOT]“What is the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle interrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on?[SEP]It’s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.[EOT]
[SOT]“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?[SEP]” the Gryphon went on.[SEP]“Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, “Hm![SEP]No accounting for tastes![SEP]Sing her ‘Turtle Soup,’ will you, old fellow?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:—[EOT]
[SOT]“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,[SEP]Waiting in a hot tureen![SEP]Who for such dainties would not stoop?[SEP]Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup![SEP]Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup![SEP]Beau—ootiful Soo—oop![SEP]Beau—ootiful Soo—oop![SEP]Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,[SEP]Beautiful, beautiful Soup![EOT]
[SOT]“Beautiful Soup![SEP]Who cares for fish,[SEP]Game, or any other dish?[SEP]Who would not give all else for two p[SEP]ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?[SEP]Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?[SEP]Beau—ootiful Soo—oop![SEP]Beau—ootiful Soo—oop![SEP]Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,[SEP]Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Chorus again![SEP]” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning![SEP]” was heard in the distance.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come on![SEP]” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.[EOT]
[SOT]“What trial is it?[SEP]” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered “Come on![SEP]” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—[EOT]
[SOT]“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,[SEP]Beautiful, beautiful Soup![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER XI.[SEP]Who Stole the Tarts?[SEP]The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other.[SEP]In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments![SEP]” But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there.[SEP]“That’s the judge,” she said to herself, “because of his great wig.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.[EOT]
[SOT]“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,” (she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.[SEP]” She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all.[SEP]However, “jury-men” would have done just as well.[EOT]
[SOT]The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.[SEP]“What are they doing?[SEP]” Alice whispered to the Gryphon.[SEP]“They can’t have anything to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply, “for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Stupid things![SEP]” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the court![SEP]” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things![SEP]” on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell “stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.[SEP]“A nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over![SEP]” thought Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.[SEP]This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away.[SEP]She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.[EOT]
[SOT]“Herald, read the accusation![SEP]” said the King.[EOT]
[SOT]On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—[EOT]
[SOT]“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,[SEP]All on a summer day:[SEP]The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,[SEP]And took them quite away![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.[EOT]
[SOT]“Not yet, not yet![SEP]” the Rabbit hastily interrupted.[SEP]“There’s a great deal to come before that![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The first witness was the Hatter.[SEP]He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.[SEP]“I beg pardon, your Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You ought to have finished,” said the King.[SEP]“When did you begin?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.[SEP]“Fourteenth of March, I think it was,” he said.[EOT]
[SOT]“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.[EOT]
[SOT]“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.[EOT]
[SOT]“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.[EOT]
[SOT]“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.[EOT]
[SOT]“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.[EOT]
[SOT]“Stolen![SEP]” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.[EOT]
[SOT]“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none of my own.[SEP]I’m a hatter.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.[EOT]
[SOT]“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll have you executed on the spot.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.[EOT]
[SOT]Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.[EOT]
[SOT]“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so,” said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her.[SEP]“I can hardly breathe.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You’ve no right to grow here,” said the Dormouse.[EOT]
[SOT]“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing too.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in that ridiculous fashion.[SEP]” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.[EOT]
[SOT]All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert![SEP]” on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.[EOT]
[SOT]“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you executed, whether you’re nervous or not.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, “—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”[EOT]
[SOT]“The twinkling of the what?[SEP]” said the King.[EOT]
[SOT]“It began with the tea,” the Hatter replied.[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course twinkling begins with a T![SEP]” said the King sharply.[SEP]“Do you take me for a dunce?[SEP]Go on![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after that—only the March Hare said—”[EOT]
[SOT]“I didn’t![SEP]” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.[EOT]
[SOT]“You did![SEP]” said the Hatter.[EOT]
[SOT]“I deny it![SEP]” said the March Hare.[EOT]
[SOT]“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.[EOT]
[SOT]“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”[EOT]
[SOT]“But what did the Dormouse say?[SEP]” one of the jury asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.[EOT]
[SOT]“You must remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee.[SEP]“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.[EOT]
[SOT]“You’re a very poor speaker,” said the King.[EOT]
[SOT]Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court.[SEP](As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.[SEP]They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.[SEP])[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice.[SEP]“I’ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempt at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the King.[EOT]
[SOT]“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Then you may sit down,” the King replied.[EOT]
[SOT]Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs![SEP]” thought Alice.[SEP]“Now we shall get on better.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.[EOT]
[SOT]“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.[EOT]
[SOT]“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.[EOT]
[SOT]“Call the next witness![SEP]” said the King.[EOT]
[SOT]The next witness was the Duchess’s cook.[SEP]She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.[EOT]
[SOT]“Give your evidence,” said the King.[EOT]
[SOT]“Shan’t,” said the cook.[EOT]
[SOT]The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, “Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.[EOT]
[SOT]“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.[EOT]
[SOT]“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out.[SEP]“Behead that Dormouse![SEP]Turn that Dormouse out of court![SEP]Suppress him![SEP]Pinch him![SEP]Off with his whiskers![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.[EOT]
[SOT]“Never mind![SEP]” said the King, with an air of great relief.[SEP]“Call the next witness.[SEP]” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness.[SEP]It quite makes my forehead ache![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they haven’t got much evidence yet,” she said to herself.[SEP]Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name “Alice![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER XII.[SEP]Alice’s Evidence[SEP]“Here![SEP]” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, I beg your pardon![SEP]” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.[EOT]
[SOT]“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until all the jurymen are back in their proper places—all,” he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.[EOT]
[SOT]Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.[SEP]She soon got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she said to herself; “I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.[EOT]
[SOT]“What do you know about this business?[SEP]” the King said to Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Nothing,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Nothing whatever?[SEP]” persisted the King.[EOT]
[SOT]“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury.[SEP]They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: “Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course,” he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.[EOT]
[SOT]“Unimportant, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone,[EOT]
[SOT]“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying which word sounded best.[EOT]
[SOT]Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.[SEP]” Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; “but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.[EOT]
[SOT]At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out “Silence![SEP]” and read out from his book, “Rule Forty-two.[SEP]All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Everybody looked at Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m not a mile high,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“You are,” said the King.[EOT]
[SOT]“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.[SEP]“Consider your verdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.[EOT]
[SOT]“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been picked up.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What’s in it?[SEP]” said the Queen.[EOT]
[SOT]“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Who is it directed to?[SEP]” said one of the jurymen.[EOT]
[SOT]“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s nothing written on the outside.[SEP]” He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?[SEP]” asked another of the jurymen.[EOT]
[SOT]“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest thing about it.[SEP]” (The jury all looked puzzled.[SEP])[EOT]
[SOT]“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King.[SEP](The jury all brightened up again.[SEP])[EOT]
[SOT]“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter worse.[SEP]You must have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your name like an honest man.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.[EOT]
[SOT]“That proves his guilt,” said the Queen.[EOT]
[SOT]“It proves nothing of the sort![SEP]” said Alice.[SEP]“Why, you don’t even know what they’re about![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Read them,” said the King.[EOT]
[SOT]The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.[SEP]“Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?[SEP]” he asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you come to the end: then stop.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—[EOT]
[SOT]“They told me you had been to her,[SEP]And mentioned me to him:[SEP]She gave me a good character,[SEP]But said I could not swim.[EOT]
[SOT]He sent them word I had not gone[SEP](We know it to be true):[SEP]If she should push the matter on,[SEP]What would become of you?[EOT]
[SOT]I gave her one, they gave him two,[SEP]You gave us three or more;[SEP]They all returned from him to you,[SEP]Though they were mine before.[EOT]
[SOT]If I or she should chance to be[SEP]Involved in this affair,[SEP]He trusts to you to set them free,[SEP]Exactly as we were.[EOT]
[SOT]My notion was that you had been[SEP](Before she had this fit)[SEP]An obstacle that came between[SEP]Him, and ourselves, and it.[EOT]
[SOT]Don’t let him know she liked them best,[SEP]For this must ever be[SEP]A secret, kept from all the rest,[SEP]Between yourself and me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the King, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”[EOT]
[SOT]“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting him), “I’ll give him sixpence.[SEP]I don’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The jury all wrote down on their slates, “She doesn’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the paper.[EOT]
[SOT]“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any.[SEP]And yet I don’t know,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.[SEP]“—said I could not swim—” you can’t swim, can you?[SEP]” he added, turning to the Knave.[EOT]
[SOT]The Knave shook his head sadly.[SEP]“Do I look like it?[SEP]” he said.[SEP](Which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.[SEP])[EOT]
[SOT]“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: “‘We know it to be true—’ that’s the jury, of course—‘I gave her one, they gave him two—’ why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know—”[EOT]
[SOT]“But, it goes on ‘they all returned from him to you,’” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why, there they are![SEP]” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table.[SEP]“Nothing can be clearer than that.[SEP]Then again—‘before she had this fit—’ you never had fits, my dear, I think?[SEP]” he said to the Queen.[EOT]
[SOT]“Never![SEP]” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.[SEP](The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.[SEP])[EOT]
[SOT]“Then the words don’t fit you,” said the King, looking round the court with a smile.[SEP]There was a dead silence.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s a pun![SEP]” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict.[SEP]” the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.[EOT]
[SOT]“No, no![SEP]” said the Queen.[SEP]“Sentence first—verdict afterwards.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Stuff and nonsense![SEP]” said Alice loudly.[SEP]“The idea of having the sentence first![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Hold your tongue![SEP]” said the Queen, turning purple.[EOT]
[SOT]“I won’t![SEP]” said Alice.[EOT]
[SOT]“Off with her head![SEP]” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.[SEP]Nobody moved.[EOT]
[SOT]“Who cares for you?[SEP]” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time).[SEP]“You’re nothing but a pack of cards![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.[EOT]
[SOT]“Wake up, Alice dear![SEP]” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve had![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream![SEP]” said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It was a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.[SEP]” So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.[EOT]
[SOT]But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:—[EOT]
[SOT]First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.[EOT]
[SOT]The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.[EOT]
[SOT]So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs.[EOT]
[SOT]Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.[EOT]

[SOT]THE BARREL ORGAN by Alfred Noyes[EOT]
[SOT]ALEXANDER’S BRIDGE by Willa Cather[EOT]
[SOT]Late one brilliant April afternoon Professor Lucius Wilson stood at the[SEP]head of Chestnut Street, looking about him with the pleased air of a[SEP]man of taste who does not very often get to Boston.[SEP]He had lived there[SEP]as a student, but for twenty years and more, since he had been[SEP]Professor of Philosophy in a Western university, he had seldom come[SEP]East except to take a steamer for some foreign port.[SEP]Wilson was[SEP]standing quite still, contemplating with a whimsical smile the slanting[SEP]street, with its worn paving, its irregular, gravely colored houses,[SEP]and the row of naked trees on which the thin sunlight was still[SEP]shining.[SEP]The gleam of the river at the foot of the hill made him blink[SEP]a little, not so much because it was too bright as because he found it[SEP]so pleasant.[SEP]The few passers-by glanced at him unconcernedly, and even[SEP]the children who hurried along with their school-bags under their arms[SEP]seemed to find it perfectly natural that a tall brown gentleman should[SEP]be standing there, looking up through his glasses at the gray[SEP]housetops.[EOT]
[SOT]The sun sank rapidly; the silvery light had faded from the bare boughs[SEP]and the watery twilight was setting in when Wilson at last walked down[SEP]the hill, descending into cooler and cooler depths of grayish shadow.[SEP]His nostril, long unused to it, was quick to detect the smell of wood[SEP]smoke in the air, blended with the odor of moist spring earth and the[SEP]saltiness that came up the river with the tide.[SEP]He crossed Charles[SEP]Street between jangling street cars and shelving lumber drays, and[SEP]after a moment of uncertainty wound into Brimmer Street.[SEP]The street was[SEP]quiet, deserted, and hung with a thin bluish haze.[SEP]He had already fixed[SEP]his sharp eye upon the house which he reasoned should be his objective[SEP]point, when he noticed a woman approaching rapidly from the opposite[SEP]direction.[SEP]Always an interested observer of women, Wilson would have[SEP]slackened his pace anywhere to follow this one with his impersonal,[SEP]appreciative glance.[SEP]She was a person of distinction he saw at once,[SEP]and, moreover, very handsome.[SEP]She was tall, carried her beautiful head[SEP]proudly, and moved with ease and certainty.[SEP]One immediately took for[SEP]granted the costly privileges and fine spaces that must lie in the[SEP]background from which such a figure could emerge with this rapid and[SEP]elegant gait.[SEP]Wilson noted her dress, too,—for, in his way, he had an[SEP]eye for such things,—particularly her brown furs and her hat.[SEP]He got a[SEP]blurred impression of her fine color, the violets she wore, her white[SEP]gloves, and, curiously enough, of her veil, as she turned up a flight[SEP]of steps in front of him and disappeared.[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson was able to enjoy lovely things that passed him on the wing as[SEP]completely and deliberately as if they had been dug-up marvels, long[SEP]anticipated, and definitely fixed at the end of a railway journey.[SEP]For[SEP]a few pleasurable seconds he quite forgot where he was going, and only[SEP]after the door had closed behind her did he realize that the young[SEP]woman had entered the house to which he had directed his trunk from the[SEP]South Station that morning.[SEP]He hesitated a moment before mounting the[SEP]steps.[SEP]“Can that,” he murmured in amazement,—“can that possibly have[SEP]been Mrs.[SEP]Alexander?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]When the servant admitted him, Mrs.[SEP]Alexander was still standing in the[SEP]hallway.[SEP]She heard him give his name, and came forward holding out her[SEP]hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“Is it you, indeed, Professor Wilson?[SEP]I was afraid that you might get[SEP]here before I did.[SEP]I was detained at a concert, and Bartley telephoned[SEP]that he would be late.[SEP]Thomas will show you your room.[SEP]Had you rather[SEP]have your tea brought to you there, or will you have it down here with[SEP]me, while we wait for Bartley?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson was pleased to find that he had been the cause of her rapid[SEP]walk, and with her he was even more vastly pleased than before.[SEP]He[SEP]followed her through the drawing-room into the library, where the wide[SEP]back windows looked out upon the garden and the sunset and a fine[SEP]stretch of silver-colored river.[SEP]A harp-shaped elm stood stripped[SEP]against the pale-colored evening sky, with ragged last year’s birds’[SEP]nests in its forks, and through the bare branches the evening star[SEP]quivered in the misty air.[SEP]The long brown room breathed the peace of a[SEP]rich and amply guarded quiet.[SEP]Tea was brought in immediately and placed[SEP]in front of the wood fire.[SEP]Mrs.[SEP]Alexander sat down in a high-backed[SEP]chair and began to pour it, while Wilson sank into a low seat opposite[SEP]her and took his cup with a great sense of ease and harmony and[SEP]comfort.[EOT]
[SOT]“You have had a long journey, haven’t you?[SEP]” Mrs.[SEP]Alexander asked, after[SEP]showing gracious concern about his tea.[SEP]“And I am so sorry Bartley is[SEP]late.[SEP]He’s often tired when he’s late.[SEP]He flatters himself that it is a[SEP]little on his account that you have come to this Congress of[SEP]Psychologists.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It is,” Wilson assented, selecting his muffin carefully; “and I hope[SEP]he won’t be tired tonight.[SEP]But, on my own account, I’m glad to have a[SEP]few moments alone with you, before Bartley comes.[SEP]I was somehow afraid[SEP]that my knowing him so well would not put me in the way of getting to[SEP]know you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s very nice of you.[SEP]” She nodded at him above her cup and smiled,[SEP]but there was a little formal tightness in her tone which had not been[SEP]there when she greeted him in the hall.[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson leaned forward.[SEP]“Have I said something awkward?[SEP]I live very far[SEP]out of the world, you know.[SEP]But I didn’t mean that you would exactly[SEP]fade dim, even if Bartley were here.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Mrs.[SEP]Alexander laughed relentingly.[SEP]“Oh, I’m not so vain![SEP]How terribly[SEP]discerning you are.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She looked straight at Wilson, and he felt that this quick, frank[SEP]glance brought about an understanding between them.[EOT]
[SOT]He liked everything about her, he told himself, but he particularly[SEP]liked her eyes; when she looked at one directly for a moment they were[SEP]like a glimpse of fine windy sky that may bring all sorts of weather.[EOT]
[SOT]“Since you noticed something,” Mrs.[SEP]Alexander went on, “it must have[SEP]been a flash of the distrust I have come to feel whenever I meet any of[SEP]the people who knew Bartley when he was a boy.[SEP]It is always as if they[SEP]were talking of someone I had never met.[SEP]Really, Professor Wilson, it[SEP]would seem that he grew up among the strangest people.[SEP]They usually say[SEP]that he has turned out very well, or remark that he always was a fine[SEP]fellow.[SEP]I never know what reply to make.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson chuckled and leaned back in his chair, shaking his left foot[SEP]gently.[SEP]“I expect the fact is that we none of us knew him very well,[SEP]Mrs.[SEP]Alexander.[SEP]Though I will say for myself that I was always[SEP]confident he’d do something extraordinary.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Mrs.[SEP]Alexander’s shoulders gave a slight movement, suggestive of[SEP]impatience.[SEP]“Oh, I should think that might have been a safe prediction.[SEP]Another cup, please?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, thank you.[SEP]But predicting, in the case of boys, is not so easy as[SEP]you might imagine, Mrs.[SEP]Alexander.[SEP]Some get a bad hurt early and lose[SEP]their courage; and some never get a fair wind.[SEP]Bartley”—he dropped his[SEP]chin on the back of his long hand and looked at her admiringly—“Bartley[SEP]caught the wind early, and it has sung in his sails ever since.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Mrs.[SEP]Alexander sat looking into the fire with intent preoccupation, and[SEP]Wilson studied her half-averted face.[SEP]He liked the suggestion of stormy[SEP]possibilities in the proud curve of her lip and nostril.[SEP]Without that,[SEP]he reflected, she would be too cold.[EOT]
[SOT]“I should like to know what he was really like when he was a boy.[SEP]I[SEP]don’t believe he remembers,” she said suddenly.[SEP]“Won’t you smoke, Mr.[SEP]Wilson?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson lit a cigarette.[SEP]“No, I don’t suppose he does.[SEP]He was never[SEP]introspective.[SEP]He was simply the most tremendous response to stimuli I[SEP]have ever known.[SEP]We didn’t know exactly what to do with him.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]A servant came in and noiselessly removed the tea-tray.[SEP]Mrs.[SEP]Alexander[SEP]screened her face from the firelight, which was beginning to throw[SEP]wavering bright spots on her dress and hair as the dusk deepened.[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course,” she said, “I now and again hear stories about things that[SEP]happened when he was in college.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But that isn’t what you want.[SEP]” Wilson wrinkled his brows and looked at[SEP]her with the smiling familiarity that had come about so quickly.[SEP]“What[SEP]you want is a picture of him, standing back there at the other end of[SEP]twenty years.[SEP]You want to look down through my memory.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She dropped her hands in her lap.[SEP]“Yes, yes; that’s exactly what I[SEP]want.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]At this moment they heard the front door shut with a jar, and Wilson[SEP]laughed as Mrs.[SEP]Alexander rose quickly.[SEP]“There he is.[SEP]Away with[SEP]perspective![SEP]No past, no future for Bartley; just the fiery moment.[SEP]The[SEP]only moment that ever was or will be in the world![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The door from the hall opened, a voice called “Winifred?[SEP]” hurriedly,[SEP]and a big man came through the drawing-room with a quick, heavy tread,[SEP]bringing with him a smell of cigar smoke and chill out-of-doors air.[SEP]When Alexander reached the library door, he switched on the lights and[SEP]stood six feet and more in the archway, glowing with strength and[SEP]cordiality and rugged, blond good looks.[SEP]There were other[SEP]bridge-builders in the world, certainly, but it was always Alexander’s[SEP]picture that the Sunday Supplement men wanted, because he looked as a[SEP]tamer of rivers ought to look.[SEP]Under his tumbled sandy hair his head[SEP]seemed as hard and powerful as a catapult, and his shoulders looked[SEP]strong enough in themselves to support a span of any one of his ten[SEP]great bridges that cut the air above as many rivers.[EOT]
[SOT]After dinner Alexander took Wilson up to his study.[SEP]It was a large room[SEP]over the library, and looked out upon the black river and the row of[SEP]white lights along the Cambridge Embankment.[SEP]The room was not at all[SEP]what one might expect of an engineer’s study.[SEP]Wilson felt at once the[SEP]harmony of beautiful things that have lived long together without[SEP]obtrusions of ugliness or change.[SEP]It was none of Alexander’s doing, of[SEP]course; those warm consonances of color had been blending and mellowing[SEP]before he was born.[SEP]But the wonder was that he was not out of place[SEP]there,—that it all seemed to glow like the inevitable background for[SEP]his vigor and vehemence.[SEP]He sat before the fire, his shoulders deep in[SEP]the cushions of his chair, his powerful head upright, his hair rumpled[SEP]above his broad forehead.[SEP]He sat heavily, a cigar in his large, smooth[SEP]hand, a flush of after-dinner color in his face, which wind and sun and[SEP]exposure to all sorts of weather had left fair and clear-skinned.[EOT]
[SOT]“You are off for England on Saturday, Bartley, Mrs.[SEP]Alexander tells[SEP]me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, for a few weeks only.[SEP]There’s a meeting of British engineers, and[SEP]I’m doing another bridge in Canada, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, every one knows about that.[SEP]And it was in Canada that you met your[SEP]wife, wasn’t it?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, at Allway.[SEP]She was visiting her great-aunt there.[SEP]A most[SEP]remarkable old lady.[SEP]I was working with MacKeller then, an old Scotch[SEP]engineer who had picked me up in London and taken me back to Quebec[SEP]with him.[SEP]He had the contract for the Allway Bridge, but before he[SEP]began work on it he found out that he was going to die, and he advised[SEP]the committee to turn the job over to me.[SEP]Otherwise I’d never have got[SEP]anything good so early.[SEP]MacKeller was an old friend of Mrs.[SEP]Pemberton,[SEP]Winifred’s aunt.[SEP]He had mentioned me to her, so when I went to Allway[SEP]she asked me to come to see her.[SEP]She was a wonderful old lady.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Like her niece?[SEP]” Wilson queried.[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley laughed.[SEP]“She had been very handsome, but not in Winifred’s[SEP]way.[SEP]When I knew her she was little and fragile, very pink and white,[SEP]with a splendid head and a face like fine old lace, somehow,—but[SEP]perhaps I always think of that because she wore a lace scarf on her[SEP]hair.[SEP]She had such a flavor of life about her.[SEP]She had known Gordon and[SEP]Livingstone and Beaconsfield when she was young,—every one.[SEP]She was the[SEP]first woman of that sort I’d ever known.[SEP]You know how it is in the[SEP]West,—old people are poked out of the way.[SEP]Aunt Eleanor fascinated me[SEP]as few young women have ever done.[SEP]I used to go up from the works to[SEP]have tea with her, and sit talking to her for hours.[SEP]It was very[SEP]stimulating, for she couldn’t tolerate stupidity.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It must have been then that your luck began, Bartley,” said Wilson,[SEP]flicking his cigar ash with his long finger.[SEP]“It’s curious, watching[SEP]boys,” he went on reflectively.[SEP]“I’m sure I did you justice in the[SEP]matter of ability.[SEP]Yet I always used to feel that there was a weak spot[SEP]where some day strain would tell.[SEP]Even after you began to climb, I[SEP]stood down in the crowd and watched you with—well, not with confidence.[SEP]The more dazzling the front you presented, the higher your facade rose,[SEP]the more I expected to see a big crack zigzagging from top to[SEP]bottom,”—he indicated its course in the air with his forefinger,—“then[SEP]a crash and clouds of dust.[SEP]It was curious.[SEP]I had such a clear picture[SEP]of it.[SEP]And another curious thing, Bartley,” Wilson spoke with[SEP]deliberateness and settled deeper into his chair, “is that I don’t feel[SEP]it any longer.[SEP]I am sure of you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander laughed.[SEP]“Nonsense![SEP]It’s not I you feel sure of; it’s[SEP]Winifred.[SEP]People often make that mistake.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No, I’m serious, Alexander.[SEP]You’ve changed.[SEP]You have decided to leave[SEP]some birds in the bushes.[SEP]You used to want them all.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander’s chair creaked.[SEP]“I still want a good many,” he said rather[SEP]gloomily.[SEP]“After all, life doesn’t offer a man much.[SEP]You work like the[SEP]devil and think you’re getting on, and suddenly you discover that[SEP]you’ve only been getting yourself tied up.[SEP]A million details drink you[SEP]dry.[SEP]Your life keeps going for things you don’t want, and all the while[SEP]you are being built alive into a social structure you don’t care a rap[SEP]about.[SEP]I sometimes wonder what sort of chap I’d have been if I hadn’t[SEP]been this sort; I want to go and live out his potentialities, too.[SEP]I[SEP]haven’t forgotten that there are birds in the bushes.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley stopped and sat frowning into the fire, his shoulders thrust[SEP]forward as if he were about to spring at something.[SEP]Wilson watched him,[SEP]wondering.[SEP]His old pupil always stimulated him at first, and then[SEP]vastly wearied him.[SEP]The machinery was always pounding away in this man,[SEP]and Wilson preferred companions of a more reflective habit of mind.[SEP]He[SEP]could not help feeling that there were unreasoning and unreasonable[SEP]activities going on in Alexander all the while; that even after dinner,[SEP]when most men achieve a decent impersonality, Bartley had merely closed[SEP]the door of the engine-room and come up for an airing.[SEP]The machinery[SEP]itself was still pounding on.[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley’s abstraction and Wilson’s reflections were cut short by a[SEP]rustle at the door, and almost before they could rise Mrs.[SEP]Alexander[SEP]was standing by the hearth.[SEP]Alexander brought a chair for her, but she[SEP]shook her head.[EOT]
[SOT]“No, dear, thank you.[SEP]I only came in to see whether you and Professor[SEP]Wilson were quite comfortable.[SEP]I am going down to the music-room.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why not practice here?[SEP]Wilson and I are growing very dull.[SEP]We are[SEP]tired of talk.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, I beg you, Mrs.[SEP]Alexander,” Wilson began, but he got no further.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why, certainly, if you won’t find me too noisy.[SEP]I am working on the[SEP]Schumann ‘Carnival,’ and, though I don’t practice a great many hours, I[SEP]am very methodical,” Mrs.[SEP]Alexander explained, as she crossed to an[SEP]upright piano that stood at the back of the room, near the windows.[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson followed, and, having seen her seated, dropped into a chair[SEP]behind her.[SEP]She played brilliantly and with great musical feeling.[SEP]Wilson could not imagine her permitting herself to do anything badly,[SEP]but he was surprised at the cleanness of her execution.[SEP]He wondered how[SEP]a woman with so many duties had managed to keep herself up to a[SEP]standard really professional.[SEP]It must take a great deal of time,[SEP]certainly, and Bartley must take a great deal of time.[SEP]Wilson reflected[SEP]that he had never before known a woman who had been able, for any[SEP]considerable while, to support both a personal and an intellectual[SEP]passion.[SEP]Sitting behind her, he watched her with perplexed admiration,[SEP]shading his eyes with his hand.[SEP]In her dinner dress she looked even[SEP]younger than in street clothes, and, for all her composure and[SEP]self-sufficiency, she seemed to him strangely alert and vibrating, as[SEP]if in her, too, there were something never altogether at rest.[SEP]He felt[SEP]that he knew pretty much what she demanded in people and what she[SEP]demanded from life, and he wondered how she squared Bartley.[SEP]After ten[SEP]years she must know him; and however one took him, however much one[SEP]admired him, one had to admit that he simply wouldn’t square.[SEP]He was a[SEP]natural force, certainly, but beyond that, Wilson felt, he was not[SEP]anything very really or for very long at a time.[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson glanced toward the fire, where Bartley’s profile was still[SEP]wreathed in cigar smoke that curled up more and more slowly.[SEP]His[SEP]shoulders were sunk deep in the cushions and one hand hung large and[SEP]passive over the arm of his chair.[SEP]He had slipped on a purple velvet[SEP]smoking-coat.[SEP]His wife, Wilson surmised, had chosen it.[SEP]She was clearly[SEP]very proud of his good looks and his fine color.[SEP]But, with the glow of[SEP]an immediate interest gone out of it, the engineer’s face looked tired,[SEP]even a little haggard.[SEP]The three lines in his forehead, directly above[SEP]the nose, deepened as he sat thinking, and his powerful head drooped[SEP]forward heavily.[SEP]Although Alexander was only forty-three, Wilson[SEP]thought that beneath his vigorous color he detected the dulling[SEP]weariness of on-coming middle age.[EOT]
[SOT]The next afternoon, at the hour when the river was beginning to redden[SEP]under the declining sun, Wilson again found himself facing Mrs.[SEP]Alexander at the tea-table in the library.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well,” he remarked, when he was bidden to give an account of himself,[SEP]“there was a long morning with the psychologists, luncheon with Bartley[SEP]at his club, more psychologists, and here I am.[SEP]I’ve looked forward to[SEP]this hour all day.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Mrs.[SEP]Alexander smiled at him across the vapor from the kettle.[SEP]“And do[SEP]you remember where we stopped yesterday?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Perfectly.[SEP]I was going to show you a picture.[SEP]But I doubt whether I[SEP]have color enough in me.[SEP]Bartley makes me feel a faded monochrome.[SEP]You[SEP]can’t get at the young Bartley except by means of color.[SEP]” Wilson paused[SEP]and deliberated.[SEP]Suddenly he broke out: “He wasn’t a remarkable[SEP]student, you know, though he was always strong in higher mathematics.[SEP]His work in my own department was quite ordinary.[SEP]It was as a[SEP]powerfully equipped nature that I found him interesting.[SEP]That is the[SEP]most interesting thing a teacher can find.[SEP]It has the fascination of a[SEP]scientific discovery.[SEP]We come across other pleasing and endearing[SEP]qualities so much oftener than we find force.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And, after all,” said Mrs.[SEP]Alexander, “that is the thing we all live[SEP]upon.[SEP]It is the thing that takes us forward.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson thought she spoke a little wistfully.[SEP]“Exactly,” he assented[SEP]warmly.[SEP]“It builds the bridges into the future, over which the feet of[SEP]every one of us will go.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“How interested I am to hear you put it in that way.[SEP]The bridges into[SEP]the future—I often say that to myself.[SEP]Bartley’s bridges always seem to[SEP]me like that.[SEP]Have you ever seen his first suspension bridge in Canada,[SEP]the one he was doing when I first knew him?[SEP]I hope you will see it[SEP]sometime.[SEP]We were married as soon as it was finished, and you will[SEP]laugh when I tell you that it always has a rather bridal look to me.[SEP]It[SEP]is over the wildest river, with mists and clouds always battling about[SEP]it, and it is as delicate as a cobweb hanging in the sky.[SEP]It really was[SEP]a bridge into the future.[SEP]You have only to look at it to feel that it[SEP]meant the beginning of a great career.[SEP]But I have a photograph of it[SEP]here.[SEP]” She drew a portfolio from behind a bookcase.[SEP]“And there, you[SEP]see, on the hill, is my aunt’s house.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson took up the photograph.[SEP]“Bartley was telling me something about[SEP]your aunt last night.[SEP]She must have been a delightful person.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Winifred laughed.[SEP]“The bridge, you see, was just at the foot of the[SEP]hill, and the noise of the engines annoyed her very much at first.[SEP]But[SEP]after she met Bartley she pretended to like it, and said it was a good[SEP]thing to be reminded that there were things going on in the world.[SEP]She[SEP]loved life, and Bartley brought a great deal of it in to her when he[SEP]came to the house.[SEP]Aunt Eleanor was very worldly in a frank,[SEP]Early-Victorian manner.[SEP]She liked men of action, and disliked young men[SEP]who were careful of themselves and who, as she put it, were always[SEP]trimming their wick as if they were afraid of their oil’s giving out.[SEP]MacKeller, Bartley’s first chief, was an old friend of my aunt, and he[SEP]told her that Bartley was a wild, ill-governed youth, which really[SEP]pleased her very much.[SEP]I remember we were sitting alone in the dusk[SEP]after Bartley had been there for the first time.[SEP]I knew that Aunt[SEP]Eleanor had found him much to her taste, but she hadn’t said anything.[SEP]Presently she came out, with a chuckle: ‘MacKeller found him sowing[SEP]wild oats in London, I believe.[SEP]I hope he didn’t stop him too soon.[SEP]Life coquets with dashing fellows.[SEP]The coming men are always like that.[SEP]We must have him to dinner, my dear.[SEP]’ And we did.[SEP]She grew much fonder[SEP]of Bartley than she was of me.[SEP]I had been studying in Vienna, and she[SEP]thought that absurd.[SEP]She was interested in the army and in politics,[SEP]and she had a great contempt for music and art and philosophy.[SEP]She used[SEP]to declare that the Prince Consort had brought all that stuff over out[SEP]of Germany.[SEP]She always sniffed when Bartley asked me to play for him.[SEP]She considered that a newfangled way of making a match of it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]When Alexander came in a few moments later, he found Wilson and his[SEP]wife still confronting the photograph.[SEP]“Oh, let us get that out of the[SEP]way,” he said, laughing.[SEP]“Winifred, Thomas can bring my trunk down.[SEP]I’ve decided to go over to New York to-morrow night and take a fast[SEP]boat.[SEP]I shall save two days.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER II[EOT]
[SOT]On the night of his arrival in London, Alexander went immediately to[SEP]the hotel on the Embankment at which he always stopped, and in the[SEP]lobby he was accosted by an old acquaintance, Maurice Mainhall, who[SEP]fell upon him with effusive cordiality and indicated a willingness to[SEP]dine with him.[SEP]Bartley never dined alone if he could help it, and[SEP]Mainhall was a good gossip who always knew what had been going on in[SEP]town; especially, he knew everything that was not printed in the[SEP]newspapers.[SEP]The nephew of one of the standard Victorian novelists,[SEP]Mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of London and[SEP]its outlying suburbs, careful to lose touch with none of them.[SEP]He had[SEP]written a number of books himself; among them a “History of Dancing,” a[SEP]“History of Costume,” a “Key to Shakespeare’s Sonnets,” a study of “The[SEP]Poetry of Ernest Dowson,” etc.[SEP]Although Mainhall’s enthusiasm was often[SEP]tiresome, and although he was often unable to distinguish between facts[SEP]and vivid figments of his imagination, his imperturbable good nature[SEP]overcame even the people whom he bored most, so that they ended by[SEP]becoming, in a reluctant manner, his friends.[SEP]In appearance, Mainhall[SEP]was astonishingly like the conventional stage-Englishman of American[SEP]drama: tall and thin, with high, hitching shoulders and a small head[SEP]glistening with closely brushed yellow hair.[SEP]He spoke with an extreme[SEP]Oxford accent, and when he was talking well, his face sometimes wore[SEP]the rapt expression of a very emotional man listening to music.[SEP]Mainhall liked Alexander because he was an engineer.[SEP]He had[SEP]preconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was[SEP]that they should be engineers or mechanics.[SEP]He hated them when they[SEP]presumed to be anything else.[EOT]
[SOT]While they sat at dinner Mainhall acquainted Bartley with the fortunes[SEP]of his old friends in London, and as they left the table he proposed[SEP]that they should go to see Hugh MacConnell’s new comedy, “Bog Lights.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s really quite the best thing MacConnell’s done,” he explained as[SEP]they got into a hansom.[SEP]“It’s tremendously well put on, too.[SEP]Florence[SEP]Merrill and Cyril Henderson.[SEP]But Hilda Burgoyne’s the hit of the piece.[SEP]Hugh’s written a delightful part for her, and she’s quite[SEP]inexpressible.[SEP]It’s been on only two weeks, and I’ve been half a dozen[SEP]times already.[SEP]I happen to have MacConnell’s box for tonight or there’d[SEP]be no chance of our getting places.[SEP]There’s everything in seeing Hilda[SEP]while she’s fresh in a part.[SEP]She’s apt to grow a bit stale after a[SEP]time.[SEP]The ones who have any imagination do.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Hilda Burgoyne![SEP]” Alexander exclaimed mildly.[SEP]“Why, I haven’t heard of[SEP]her for—years.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Mainhall laughed.[SEP]“Then you can’t have heard much at all, my dear[SEP]Alexander.[SEP]It’s only lately, since MacConnell and his set have got hold[SEP]of her, that she’s come up.[SEP]Myself, I always knew she had it in her.[SEP]If[SEP]we had one real critic in London—but what can one expect?[SEP]Do you know,[SEP]Alexander,”—Mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the[SEP]hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger,—“do you know,[SEP]I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself.[SEP]In a way, it[SEP]would be a sacrifice; but, dear me, we do need some one.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Just then they drove up to the Duke of York’s, so Alexander did not[SEP]commit himself, but followed Mainhall into the theatre.[SEP]When they[SEP]entered the stage-box on the left the first act was well under way, the[SEP]scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of Ireland.[SEP]As they[SEP]sat down, a burst of applause drew Alexander’s attention to the stage.[SEP]Miss Burgoyne and her donkey were thrusting their heads in at the half[SEP]door.[SEP]“After all,” he reflected, “there’s small probability of her[SEP]recognizing me.[SEP]She doubtless hasn’t thought of me for years.[SEP]” He felt[SEP]the enthusiasm of the house at once, and in a few moments he was caught[SEP]up by the current of MacConnell’s irresistible comedy.[SEP]The audience had[SEP]come forewarned, evidently, and whenever the ragged slip of a[SEP]donkey-girl ran upon the stage there was a deep murmur of approbation,[SEP]every one smiled and glowed, and Mainhall hitched his heavy chair a[SEP]little nearer the brass railing.[EOT]
[SOT]“You see,” he murmured in Alexander’s ear, as the curtain fell on the[SEP]first act, “one almost never sees a part like that done without[SEP]smartness or mawkishness.[SEP]Of course, Hilda is Irish,—the Burgoynes have[SEP]been stage people for generations,—and she has the Irish voice.[SEP]It’s[SEP]delightful to hear it in a London theatre.[SEP]That laugh, now, when she[SEP]doubles over at the hips—who ever heard it out of Galway?[SEP]She saves her[SEP]hand, too.[SEP]She’s at her best in the second act.[SEP]She’s really[SEP]MacConnell’s poetic motif, you see; makes the whole thing a fairy[SEP]tale.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The second act opened before Philly Doyle’s underground still, with[SEP]Peggy and her battered donkey come in to smuggle a load of potheen[SEP]across the bog, and to bring Philly word of what was doing in the world[SEP]without, and of what was happening along the roadsides and ditches with[SEP]the first gleam of fine weather.[SEP]Alexander, annoyed by Mainhall’s sighs[SEP]and exclamations, watched her with keen, half-skeptical interest.[SEP]As[SEP]Mainhall had said, she was the second act; the plot and feeling alike[SEP]depended upon her lightness of foot, her lightness of touch, upon the[SEP]shrewdness and deft fancifulness that played alternately, and sometimes[SEP]together, in her mirthful brown eyes.[SEP]When she began to dance, by way[SEP]of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night,[SEP]the house broke into a prolonged uproar.[SEP]After her dance she withdrew[SEP]from the dialogue and retreated to the ditch wall back of Philly’s[SEP]burrow, where she sat singing “The Rising of the Moon” and making a[SEP]wreath of primroses for her donkey.[EOT]
[SOT]When the act was over Alexander and Mainhall strolled out into the[SEP]corridor.[SEP]They met a good many acquaintances; Mainhall, indeed, knew[SEP]almost every one, and he babbled on incontinently, screwing his small[SEP]head about over his high collar.[SEP]Presently he hailed a tall, bearded[SEP]man, grim-browed and rather battered-looking, who had his opera cloak[SEP]on his arm and his hat in his hand, and who seemed to be on the point[SEP]of leaving the theatre.[EOT]
[SOT]“MacConnell, let me introduce Mr. Bartley Alexander.[SEP]I say![SEP]It’s going[SEP]famously to-night, Mac.[SEP]And what an audience![SEP]You’ll never do anything[SEP]like this again, mark me.[SEP]A man writes to the top of his bent only[SEP]once.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The playwright gave Mainhall a curious look out of his deep-set faded[SEP]eyes and made a wry face.[SEP]“And have I done anything so fool as that,[SEP]now?[SEP]” he asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s what I was saying,” Mainhall lounged a little nearer and[SEP]dropped into a tone even more conspicuously confidential.[SEP]“And you’ll[SEP]never bring Hilda out like this again.[SEP]Dear me, Mac, the girl couldn’t[SEP]possibly be better, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]MacConnell grunted.[SEP]“She’ll do well enough if she keeps her pace and[SEP]doesn’t go off on us in the middle of the season, as she’s more than[SEP]like to do.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He nodded curtly and made for the door, dodging acquaintances as he[SEP]went.[EOT]
[SOT]“Poor old Hugh,” Mainhall murmured.[SEP]“He’s hit terribly hard.[SEP]He’s been[SEP]wanting to marry Hilda these three years and more.[SEP]She doesn’t take up[SEP]with anybody, you know.[SEP]Irene Burgoyne, one of her family, told me in[SEP]confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning.[SEP]One of your countrymen, Alexander, by the way; an American student whom[SEP]she met in Paris, I believe.[SEP]I dare say it’s quite true that there’s[SEP]never been any one else.[SEP]” Mainhall vouched for her constancy with a[SEP]loftiness that made Alexander smile, even while a kind of rapid[SEP]excitement was tingling through him.[SEP]Blinking up at the lights,[SEP]Mainhall added in his luxurious, worldly way: “She’s an elegant little[SEP]person, and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that.[SEP]Here comes Sir Harry Towne.[SEP]He’s another who’s awfully keen about her.[SEP]Let me introduce you.[SEP]Sir Harry Towne, Mr. Bartley Alexander, the[SEP]American engineer.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Sir Harry Towne bowed and said that he had met Mr. Alexander and his[SEP]wife in Tokyo.[EOT]
[SOT]Mainhall cut in impatiently.[EOT]
[SOT]“I say, Sir Harry, the little girl’s going famously to-night, isn’t[SEP]she?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Sir Harry wrinkled his brows judiciously.[SEP]“Do you know, I thought the[SEP]dance a bit conscious to-night, for the first time.[SEP]The fact is, she’s[SEP]feeling rather seedy, poor child.[SEP]Westmere and I were back after the[SEP]first act, and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself.[SEP]A[SEP]little attack of nerves, possibly.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He bowed as the warning bell rang, and Mainhall whispered: “You know[SEP]Lord Westmere, of course,—the stooped man with the long gray mustache,[SEP]talking to Lady Dowle.[SEP]Lady Westmere is very fond of Hilda.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]When they reached their box the house was darkened and the orchestra[SEP]was playing “The Cloak of Old Gaul.[SEP]” In a moment Peggy was on the stage[SEP]again, and Alexander applauded vigorously with the rest.[SEP]He even leaned[SEP]forward over the rail a little.[SEP]For some reason he felt pleased and[SEP]flattered by the enthusiasm of the audience.[SEP]In the half-light he[SEP]looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously,[SEP]recalling with amusement Sir Harry’s judicial frown.[SEP]He was beginning[SEP]to feel a keen interest in the slender, barefoot donkey-girl who[SEP]slipped in and out of the play, singing, like some one winding through[SEP]a hilly field.[SEP]He leaned forward and beamed felicitations as warmly as[SEP]Mainhall himself when, at the end of the play, she came again and again[SEP]before the curtain, panting a little and flushed, her eyes dancing and[SEP]her eager, nervous little mouth tremulous with excitement.[EOT]
[SOT]When Alexander returned to his hotel—he shook Mainhall at the door of[SEP]the theatre—he had some supper brought up to his room, and it was late[SEP]before he went to bed.[SEP]He had not thought of Hilda Burgoyne for years;[SEP]indeed, he had almost forgotten her.[SEP]He had last written to her from[SEP]Canada, after he first met Winifred, telling her that everything was[SEP]changed with him—that he had met a woman whom he would marry if he[SEP]could; if he could not, then all the more was everything changed for[SEP]him.[SEP]Hilda had never replied to his letter.[SEP]He felt guilty and unhappy[SEP]about her for a time, but after Winifred promised to marry him he[SEP]really forgot Hilda altogether.[SEP]When he wrote her that everything was[SEP]changed for him, he was telling the truth.[SEP]After he met Winifred[SEP]Pemberton he seemed to himself like a different man.[SEP]One night when he[SEP]and Winifred were sitting together on the bridge, he told her that[SEP]things had happened while he was studying abroad that he was sorry[SEP]for,—one thing in particular,—and he asked her whether she thought she[SEP]ought to know about them.[SEP]She considered a moment and then said “No, I[SEP]think not, though I am glad you ask me.[SEP]You see, one can’t be jealous[SEP]about things in general; but about particular, definite, personal[SEP]things,”—here she had thrown her hands up to his shoulders with a[SEP]quick, impulsive gesture—“oh, about those I should be very jealous.[SEP]I[SEP]should torture myself—I couldn’t help it.[SEP]” After that it was easy to[SEP]forget, actually to forget.[SEP]He wondered to-night, as he poured his[SEP]wine, how many times he had thought of Hilda in the last ten years.[SEP]He[SEP]had been in London more or less, but he had never happened to hear of[SEP]her.[SEP]“All the same,” he lifted his glass, “here’s to you, little Hilda.[SEP]You’ve made things come your way, and I never thought you’d do it.[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course,” he reflected, “she always had that combination of[SEP]something homely and sensible, and something utterly wild and daft.[SEP]But[SEP]I never thought she’d do anything.[SEP]She hadn’t much ambition then, and[SEP]she was too fond of trifles.[SEP]She must care about the theatre a great[SEP]deal more than she used to.[SEP]Perhaps she has me to thank for something,[SEP]after all.[SEP]Sometimes a little jolt like that does one good.[SEP]She was a[SEP]daft, generous little thing.[SEP]I’m glad she’s held her own since.[SEP]After[SEP]all, we were awfully young.[SEP]It was youth and poverty and proximity, and[SEP]everything was young and kindly.[SEP]I shouldn’t wonder if she could laugh[SEP]about it with me now.[SEP]I shouldn’t wonder— But they’ve probably spoiled[SEP]her, so that she’d be tiresome if one met her again.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER III[EOT]
[SOT]The next evening Alexander dined alone at a club, and at about nine[SEP]o’clock he dropped in at the Duke of York’s.[SEP]The house was sold out and[SEP]he stood through the second act.[SEP]When he returned to his hotel he[SEP]examined the new directory, and found Miss Burgoyne’s address still[SEP]given as off Bedford Square, though at a new number.[SEP]He remembered[SEP]that, in so far as she had been brought up at all, she had been brought[SEP]up in Bloomsbury.[SEP]Her father and mother played in the provinces most of[SEP]the year, and she was left a great deal in the care of an old aunt who[SEP]was crippled by rheumatism and who had had to leave the stage[SEP]altogether.[SEP]In the days when Alexander knew her, Hilda always managed[SEP]to have a lodging of some sort about Bedford Square, because she clung[SEP]tenaciously to such scraps and shreds of memories as were connected[SEP]with it.[SEP]The mummy room of the British Museum had been one of the chief[SEP]delights of her childhood.[SEP]That forbidding pile was the goal of her[SEP]truant fancy, and she was sometimes taken there for a treat, as other[SEP]children are taken to the theatre.[SEP]It was long since Alexander had[SEP]thought of any of these things, but now they came back to him quite[SEP]fresh, and had a significance they did not have when they were first[SEP]told him in his restless twenties.[SEP]So she was still in the old[SEP]neighborhood, near Bedford Square.[SEP]The new number probably meant[SEP]increased prosperity.[SEP]He hoped so.[SEP]He would like to know that she was[SEP]snugly settled.[SEP]He looked at his watch.[SEP]It was a quarter past ten; she[SEP]would not be home for a good two hours yet, and he might as well walk[SEP]over and have a look at the place.[SEP]He remembered the shortest way.[EOT]
[SOT]It was a warm, smoky evening, and there was a grimy moon.[SEP]He went[SEP]through Covent Garden to Oxford Street, and as he turned into Museum[SEP]Street he walked more slowly, smiling at his own nervousness as he[SEP]approached the sullen gray mass at the end.[SEP]He had not been inside the[SEP]Museum, actually, since he and Hilda used to meet there; sometimes to[SEP]set out for gay adventures at Twickenham or Richmond, sometimes to[SEP]linger about the place for a while and to ponder by Lord Elgin’s[SEP]marbles upon the lastingness of some things, or, in the mummy room,[SEP]upon the awful brevity of others.[SEP]Since then Bartley had always thought[SEP]of the British Museum as the ultimate repository of mortality, where[SEP]all the dead things in the world were assembled to make one’s hour of[SEP]youth the more precious.[SEP]One trembled lest before he got out it might[SEP]somehow escape him, lest he might drop the glass from over-eagerness[SEP]and see it shivered on the stone floor at his feet.[SEP]How one hid his[SEP]youth under his coat and hugged it![SEP]And how good it was to turn one’s[SEP]back upon all that vaulted cold, to take Hilda’s arm and hurry out of[SEP]the great door and down the steps into the sunlight among the[SEP]pigeons—to know that the warm and vital thing within him was still[SEP]there and had not been snatched away to flush Cæsar’s lean cheek or to[SEP]feed the veins of some bearded Assyrian king.[SEP]They in their day had[SEP]carried the flaming liquor, but to-day was his![SEP]So the song used to run[SEP]in his head those summer mornings a dozen years ago.[SEP]Alexander walked[SEP]by the place very quietly, as if he were afraid of waking some one.[EOT]
[SOT]He crossed Bedford Square and found the number he was looking for.[SEP]The[SEP]house, a comfortable, well-kept place enough, was dark except for the[SEP]four front windows on the second floor, where a low, even light was[SEP]burning behind the white muslin sash curtains.[SEP]Outside there were[SEP]window boxes, painted white and full of flowers.[SEP]Bartley was making a[SEP]third round of the Square when he heard the far-flung hoof-beats of a[SEP]hansom-cab horse, driven rapidly.[SEP]He looked at his watch, and was[SEP]astonished to find that it was a few minutes after twelve.[SEP]He turned[SEP]and walked back along the iron railing as the cab came up to Hilda’s[SEP]number and stopped.[SEP]The hansom must have been one that she employed[SEP]regularly, for she did not stop to pay the driver.[SEP]She stepped out[SEP]quickly and lightly.[SEP]He heard her cheerful “Good-night, cabby,” as she[SEP]ran up the steps and opened the door with a latchkey.[SEP]In a few moments[SEP]the lights flared up brightly behind the white curtains, and as he[SEP]walked away he heard a window raised.[SEP]But he had gone too far to look[SEP]up without turning round.[SEP]He went back to his hotel, feeling that he[SEP]had had a good evening, and he slept well.[EOT]
[SOT]For the next few days Alexander was very busy.[SEP]He took a desk in the[SEP]office of a Scotch engineering firm on Henrietta Street, and was at[SEP]work almost constantly.[SEP]He avoided the clubs and usually dined alone at[SEP]his hotel.[SEP]One afternoon, after he had tea, he started for a walk down[SEP]the Embankment toward Westminster, intending to end his stroll at[SEP]Bedford Square and to ask whether Miss Burgoyne would let him take her[SEP]to the theatre.[SEP]But he did not go so far.[SEP]When he reached the Abbey, he[SEP]turned back and crossed Westminster Bridge and sat down to watch the[SEP]trails of smoke behind the Houses of Parliament catch fire with the[SEP]sunset.[SEP]The slender towers were washed by a rain of golden light and[SEP]licked by little flickering flames; Somerset House and the bleached[SEP]gray pinnacles about Whitehall were floated in a luminous haze.[SEP]The[SEP]yellow light poured through the trees and the leaves seemed to burn[SEP]with soft fires.[SEP]There was a smell of acacias in the air everywhere,[SEP]and the laburnums were dripping gold over the walls of the gardens.[SEP]It[SEP]was a sweet, lonely kind of summer evening.[SEP]Remembering Hilda as she[SEP]used to be, was doubtless more satisfactory than seeing her as she must[SEP]be now—and, after all, Alexander asked himself, what was it but his own[SEP]young years that he was remembering?[EOT]
[SOT]He crossed back to Westminster, went up to the Temple, and sat down to[SEP]smoke in the Middle Temple gardens, listening to the thin voice of the[SEP]fountain and smelling the spice of the sycamores that came out heavily[SEP]in the damp evening air.[SEP]He thought, as he sat there, about a great[SEP]many things: about his own youth and Hilda’s; above all, he thought of[SEP]how glorious it had been, and how quickly it had passed; and, when it[SEP]had passed, how little worth while anything was.[SEP]None of the things he[SEP]had gained in the least compensated.[SEP]In the last six years his[SEP]reputation had become, as the saying is, popular.[SEP]Four years ago he had[SEP]been called to Japan to deliver, at the Emperor’s request, a course of[SEP]lectures at the Imperial University, and had instituted reforms[SEP]throughout the islands, not only in the practice of bridge-building but[SEP]in drainage and road-making.[SEP]On his return he had undertaken the bridge[SEP]at Moorlock, in Canada, the most important piece of bridge-building[SEP]going on in the world,—a test, indeed, of how far the latest practice[SEP]in bridge structure could be carried.[SEP]It was a spectacular undertaking[SEP]by reason of its very size, and Bartley realized that, whatever else he[SEP]might do, he would probably always be known as the engineer who[SEP]designed the great Moorlock Bridge, the longest cantilever in[SEP]existence.[SEP]Yet it was to him the least satisfactory thing he had ever[SEP]done.[SEP]He was cramped in every way by a niggardly commission, and was[SEP]using lighter structural material than he thought proper.[SEP]He had[SEP]vexations enough, too, with his work at home.[SEP]He had several bridges[SEP]under way in the United States, and they were always being held up by[SEP]strikes and delays resulting from a general industrial unrest.[EOT]
[SOT]Though Alexander often told himself he had never put more into his work[SEP]than he had done in the last few years, he had to admit that he had[SEP]never got so little out of it.[SEP]He was paying for success, too, in the[SEP]demands made on his time by boards of civic enterprise and committees[SEP]of public welfare.[SEP]The obligations imposed by his wife’s fortune and[SEP]position were sometimes distracting to a man who followed his[SEP]profession, and he was expected to be interested in a great many worthy[SEP]endeavors on her account as well as on his own.[SEP]His existence was[SEP]becoming a network of great and little details.[SEP]He had expected that[SEP]success would bring him freedom and power; but it had brought only[SEP]power that was in itself another kind of restraint.[SEP]He had always meant[SEP]to keep his personal liberty at all costs, as old MacKeller, his first[SEP]chief, had done, and not, like so many American engineers, to become a[SEP]part of a professional movement, a cautious board member, a Nestor _de[SEP]pontibus_.[SEP]He happened to be engaged in work of public utility, but he[SEP]was not willing to become what is called a public man.[SEP]He found himself[SEP]living exactly the kind of life he had determined to escape.[SEP]What, he[SEP]asked himself, did he want with these genial honors and substantial[SEP]comforts?[SEP]Hardships and difficulties he had carried lightly; overwork[SEP]had not exhausted him; but this dead calm of middle life which[SEP]confronted him,—of that he was afraid.[SEP]He was not ready for it.[SEP]It was[SEP]like being buried alive.[SEP]In his youth he would not have believed such a[SEP]thing possible.[SEP]The one thing he had really wanted all his life was to[SEP]be free; and there was still something unconquered in him, something[SEP]besides the strong work-horse that his profession had made of him.[SEP]He[SEP]felt rich to-night in the possession of that unstultified survival; in[SEP]the light of his experience, it was more precious than honors or[SEP]achievement.[SEP]In all those busy, successful years there had been nothing[SEP]so good as this hour of wild light-heartedness.[SEP]This feeling was the[SEP]only happiness that was real to him, and such hours were the only ones[SEP]in which he could feel his own continuous identity—feel the boy he had[SEP]been in the rough days of the old West, feel the youth who had worked[SEP]his way across the ocean on a cattle-ship and gone to study in Paris[SEP]without a dollar in his pocket.[SEP]The man who sat in his offices in[SEP]Boston was only a powerful machine.[SEP]Under the activities of that[SEP]machine the person who, in such moments as this, he felt to be himself,[SEP]was fading and dying.[SEP]He remembered how, when he was a little boy and[SEP]his father called him in the morning, he used to leap from his bed into[SEP]the full consciousness of himself.[SEP]That consciousness was Life itself.[SEP]Whatever took its place, action, reflection, the power of concentrated[SEP]thought, were only functions of a mechanism useful to society; things[SEP]that could be bought in the market.[SEP]There was only one thing that had[SEP]an absolute value for each individual, and it was just that original[SEP]impulse, that internal heat, that feeling of one’s self in one’s own[SEP]breast.[EOT]
[SOT]When Alexander walked back to his hotel, the red and green lights were[SEP]blinking along the docks on the farther shore, and the soft white stars[SEP]were shining in the wide sky above the river.[EOT]
[SOT]The next night, and the next, Alexander repeated this same foolish[SEP]performance.[SEP]It was always Miss Burgoyne whom he started out to find,[SEP]and he got no farther than the Temple gardens and the Embankment.[SEP]It[SEP]was a pleasant kind of loneliness.[SEP]To a man who was so little given to[SEP]reflection, whose dreams always took the form of definite ideas,[SEP]reaching into the future, there was a seductive excitement in renewing[SEP]old experiences in imagination.[SEP]He started out upon these walks half[SEP]guiltily, with a curious longing and expectancy which were wholly[SEP]gratified by solitude.[SEP]Solitude, but not solitariness; for he walked[SEP]shoulder to shoulder with a shadowy companion—not little Hilda[SEP]Burgoyne, by any means, but some one vastly dearer to him than she had[SEP]ever been—his own young self, the youth who had waited for him upon the[SEP]steps of the British Museum that night, and who, though he had tried to[SEP]pass so quietly, had known him and come down and linked an arm in his.[EOT]
[SOT]It was not until long afterward that Alexander learned that for him[SEP]this youth was the most dangerous of companions.[EOT]
[SOT]One Sunday evening, at Lady Walford’s, Alexander did at last meet Hilda[SEP]Burgoyne.[SEP]Mainhall had told him that she would probably be there.[SEP]He[SEP]looked about for her rather nervously, and finally found her at the[SEP]farther end of the large drawing-room, the centre of a circle of men,[SEP]young and old.[SEP]She was apparently telling them a story.[SEP]They were all[SEP]laughing and bending toward her.[SEP]When she saw Alexander, she rose[SEP]quickly and put out her hand.[SEP]The other men drew back a little to let[SEP]him approach.[EOT]
[SOT]“Mr. Alexander![SEP]I am delighted.[SEP]Have you been in London long?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley bowed, somewhat laboriously, over her hand.[SEP]“Long enough to[SEP]have seen you more than once.[SEP]How fine it all is![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She laughed as if she were pleased.[SEP]“I’m glad you think so.[SEP]I like it.[SEP]Won’t you join us here?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Miss Burgoyne was just telling us about a donkey-boy she had in Galway[SEP]last summer,” Sir Harry Towne explained as the circle closed up again.[SEP]Lord Westmere stroked his long white mustache with his bloodless hand[SEP]and looked at Alexander blankly.[SEP]Hilda was a good story-teller.[SEP]She was[SEP]sitting on the edge of her chair, as if she had alighted there for a[SEP]moment only.[SEP]Her primrose satin gown seemed like a soft sheath for her[SEP]slender, supple figure, and its delicate color suited her white Irish[SEP]skin and brown hair.[SEP]Whatever she wore, people felt the charm of her[SEP]active, girlish body with its slender hips and quick, eager shoulders.[SEP]Alexander heard little of the story, but he watched Hilda intently.[SEP]She[SEP]must certainly, he reflected, be thirty, and he was honestly delighted[SEP]to see that the years had treated her so indulgently.[SEP]If her face had[SEP]changed at all, it was in a slight hardening of the mouth—still eager[SEP]enough to be very disconcerting at times, he felt—and in an added air[SEP]of self-possession and self-reliance.[SEP]She carried her head, too, a[SEP]little more resolutely.[EOT]
[SOT]When the story was finished, Miss Burgoyne turned pointedly to[SEP]Alexander, and the other men drifted away.[EOT]
[SOT]“I thought I saw you in MacConnell’s box with Mainhall one evening, but[SEP]I supposed you had left town before this.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She looked at him frankly and cordially, as if he were indeed merely an[SEP]old friend whom she was glad to meet again.[EOT]
[SOT]“No, I’ve been mooning about here.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda laughed gayly.[SEP]“Mooning![SEP]I see you mooning![SEP]You must be the[SEP]busiest man in the world.[SEP]Time and success have done well by you, you[SEP]know.[SEP]You’re handsomer than ever and you’ve gained a grand manner.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander blushed and bowed.[SEP]“Time and success have been good friends[SEP]to both of us.[SEP]Aren’t you tremendously pleased with yourself?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She laughed again and shrugged her shoulders.[SEP]“Oh, so-so.[SEP]But I want to[SEP]hear about you.[SEP]Several years ago I read such a lot in the papers about[SEP]the wonderful things you did in Japan, and how the Emperor decorated[SEP]you.[SEP]What was it, Commander of the Order of the Rising Sun?[SEP]That sounds[SEP]like ‘The Mikado.[SEP]’ And what about your new bridge—in Canada, isn’t it,[SEP]and it’s to be the longest one in the world and has some queer name I[SEP]can’t remember.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley shook his head and smiled drolly.[SEP]“Since when have you been[SEP]interested in bridges?[SEP]Or have you learned to be interested in[SEP]everything?[SEP]And is that a part of success?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why, how absurd![SEP]As if I were not always interested![SEP]” Hilda exclaimed.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, I think we won’t talk about bridges here, at any rate.[SEP]” Bartley[SEP]looked down at the toe of her yellow slipper which was tapping the rug[SEP]impatiently under the hem of her gown.[SEP]“But I wonder whether you’d[SEP]think me impertinent if I asked you to let me come to see you sometime[SEP]and tell you about them?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why should I?[SEP]Ever so many people come on Sunday afternoons.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I know.[SEP]Mainhall offered to take me.[SEP]But you must know that I’ve been[SEP]in London several times within the last few years, and you might very[SEP]well think that just now is a rather inopportune time—”[EOT]
[SOT]She cut him short.[SEP]“Nonsense.[SEP]One of the pleasantest things about[SEP]success is that it makes people want to look one up, if that’s what you[SEP]mean.[SEP]I’m like every one else—more agreeable to meet when things are[SEP]going well with me.[SEP]Don’t you suppose it gives me any pleasure to do[SEP]something that people like?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Does it?[SEP]Oh, how fine it all is, your coming on like this![SEP]But I[SEP]didn’t want you to think it was because of that I wanted to see you.[SEP]”[SEP]He spoke very seriously and looked down at the floor.[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda studied him in wide-eyed astonishment for a moment, and then[SEP]broke into a low, amused laugh.[SEP]“My dear Mr. Alexander, you have[SEP]strange delicacies.[SEP]If you please, that is exactly why you wish to see[SEP]me.[SEP]We understand that, do we not?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley looked ruffled and turned the seal ring on his little finger[SEP]about awkwardly.[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda leaned back in her chair, watching him indulgently out of her[SEP]shrewd eyes.[SEP]“Come, don’t be angry, but don’t try to pose for me, or to[SEP]be anything but what you are.[SEP]If you care to come, it’s yourself I’ll[SEP]be glad to see, and you thinking well of yourself.[SEP]Don’t try to wear a[SEP]cloak of humility; it doesn’t become you.[SEP]Stalk in as you are and don’t[SEP]make excuses.[SEP]I’m not accustomed to inquiring into the motives of my[SEP]guests.[SEP]That would hardly be safe, even for Lady Walford, in a great[SEP]house like this.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Sunday afternoon, then,” said Alexander, as she rose to join her[SEP]hostess.[SEP]“How early may I come?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She gave him her hand and flushed and laughed.[SEP]He bent over it a little[SEP]stiffly.[SEP]She went away on Lady Walford’s arm, and as he stood watching[SEP]her yellow train glide down the long floor he looked rather sullen.[SEP]He[SEP]felt that he had not come out of it very brilliantly.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER IV[EOT]
[SOT]On Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Burgoyne’s invitation and[SEP]called at her apartment.[SEP]He found it a delightful little place and he[SEP]met charming people there.[SEP]Hilda lived alone, attended by a very pretty[SEP]and competent French servant who answered the door and brought in the[SEP]tea.[SEP]Alexander arrived early, and some twenty-odd people dropped in[SEP]during the course of the afternoon.[SEP]Hugh MacConnell came with his[SEP]sister, and stood about, managing his tea-cup awkwardly and watching[SEP]every one out of his deep-set, faded eyes.[SEP]He seemed to have made a[SEP]resolute effort at tidiness of attire, and his sister, a robust, florid[SEP]woman with a splendid joviality about her, kept eyeing his freshly[SEP]creased clothes apprehensively.[SEP]It was not very long, indeed, before[SEP]his coat hung with a discouraged sag from his gaunt shoulders and his[SEP]hair and beard were rumpled as if he had been out in a gale.[SEP]His dry[SEP]humor went under a cloud of absent-minded kindliness which, Mainhall[SEP]explained, always overtook him here.[SEP]He was never so witty or so sharp[SEP]here as elsewhere, and Alexander thought he behaved as if he were an[SEP]elderly relative come in to a young girl’s party.[EOT]
[SOT]The editor of a monthly review came with his wife, and Lady Kildare,[SEP]the Irish philanthropist, brought her young nephew, Robert Owen, who[SEP]had come up from Oxford, and who was visibly excited and gratified by[SEP]his first introduction to Miss Burgoyne.[SEP]Hilda was very nice to him,[SEP]and he sat on the edge of his chair, flushed with his conversational[SEP]efforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar.[SEP]Sarah[SEP]Frost, the novelist, came with her husband, a very genial and placid[SEP]old scholar who had become slightly deranged upon the subject of the[SEP]fourth dimension.[SEP]On other matters he was perfectly rational and he was[SEP]easy and pleasing in conversation.[SEP]He looked very much like Agassiz,[SEP]and his wife, in her old-fashioned black silk dress, overskirted and[SEP]tight-sleeved, reminded Alexander of the early pictures of Mrs.[SEP]Browning.[SEP]Hilda seemed particularly fond of this quaint couple, and[SEP]Bartley himself was so pleased with their mild and thoughtful converse[SEP]that he took his leave when they did, and walked with them over to[SEP]Oxford Street, where they waited for their ‘bus.[SEP]They asked him to come[SEP]to see them in Chelsea, and they spoke very tenderly of Hilda.[SEP]“She’s a[SEP]dear, unworldly little thing,” said the philosopher absently; “more[SEP]like the stage people of my young days—folk of simple manners.[SEP]There[SEP]aren’t many such left.[SEP]American tours have spoiled them, I’m afraid.[SEP]They have all grown very smart.[SEP]Lamb wouldn’t care a great deal about[SEP]many of them, I fancy.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander went back to Bedford Square a second Sunday afternoon.[SEP]He had[SEP]a long talk with MacConnell, but he got no word with Hilda alone, and[SEP]he left in a discontented state of mind.[SEP]For the rest of the week he[SEP]was nervous and unsettled, and kept rushing his work as if he were[SEP]preparing for immediate departure.[SEP]On Thursday afternoon he cut short a[SEP]committee meeting, jumped into a hansom, and drove to Bedford Square.[SEP]He sent up his card, but it came back to him with a message scribbled[SEP]across the front.[EOT]
[SOT]So sorry I can’t see you.[SEP]Will you come and dine with me Sunday[SEP]evening at half-past seven?[EOT]
[SOT]When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the[SEP]pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him[SEP]upstairs.[SEP]Hilda was writing in her living-room, under the light of a[SEP]tall desk lamp.[SEP]Bartley recognized the primrose satin gown she had worn[SEP]that first evening at Lady Walford’s.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m so pleased that you think me worth that yellow dress, you know,”[SEP]he said, taking her hand and looking her over admiringly from the toes[SEP]of her canary slippers to her smoothly parted brown hair.[SEP]“Yes, it’s[SEP]very, very pretty.[SEP]Every one at Lady Walford’s was looking at it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda curtsied.[SEP]“Is that why you think it pretty?[SEP]I’ve no need for fine[SEP]clothes in Mac’s play this time, so I can afford a few duddies for[SEP]myself.[SEP]It’s owing to that same chance, by the way, that I am able to[SEP]ask you to dinner.[SEP]I don’t need Marie to dress me this season, so she[SEP]keeps house for me, and my little Galway girl has gone home for a[SEP]visit.[SEP]I should never have asked you if Molly had been here, for I[SEP]remember you don’t like English cookery.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander walked about the room, looking at everything.[EOT]
[SOT]“I haven’t had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I[SEP]think this is.[SEP]Where did you get those etchings?[SEP]They’re quite unusual,[SEP]aren’t they?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Lady Westmere sent them to me from Rome last Christmas.[SEP]She is very[SEP]much interested in the American artist who did them.[SEP]They are all[SEP]sketches made about the Villa d’Este, you see.[SEP]He painted that group of[SEP]cypresses for the Salon, and it was bought for the Luxembourg.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander walked over to the bookcases.[SEP]“It’s the air of the whole[SEP]place here that I like.[SEP]You haven’t got anything that doesn’t belong.[SEP]Seems to me it looks particularly well to-night.[SEP]And you have so many[SEP]flowers.[SEP]I like these little yellow irises.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Rooms always look better by lamplight—in London, at least.[SEP]Though[SEP]Marie is clean—really clean, as the French are.[SEP]Why do you look at the[SEP]flowers so critically?[SEP]Marie got them all fresh in Covent Garden market[SEP]yesterday morning.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m glad,” said Alexander simply.[SEP]“I can’t tell you how glad I am to[SEP]have you so pretty and comfortable here, and to hear every one saying[SEP]such nice things about you.[SEP]You’ve got awfully nice friends,” he added[SEP]humbly, picking up a little jade elephant from her desk.[SEP]“Those fellows[SEP]are all very loyal, even Mainhall.[SEP]They don’t talk of any one else as[SEP]they do of you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda sat down on the couch and said seriously: “I’ve a neat little sum[SEP]in the bank, too, now, and I own a mite of a hut in Galway.[SEP]It’s not[SEP]worth much, but I love it.[SEP]I’ve managed to save something every year,[SEP]and that with helping my three sisters now and then, and tiding poor[SEP]Cousin Mike over bad seasons.[SEP]He’s that gifted, you know, but he will[SEP]drink and loses more good engagements than other fellows ever get.[SEP]And[SEP]I’ve traveled a bit, too.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Marie opened the door and smilingly announced that dinner was served.[EOT]
[SOT]“My dining-room,” Hilda explained, as she led the way, “is the tiniest[SEP]place you have ever seen.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]It was a tiny room, hung all round with French prints, above which ran[SEP]a shelf full of china.[SEP]Hilda saw Alexander look up at it.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s not particularly rare,” she said, “but some of it was my[SEP]mother’s.[SEP]Heaven knows how she managed to keep it whole, through all[SEP]our wanderings, or in what baskets and bundles and theatre trunks it[SEP]hasn’t been stowed away.[SEP]We always had our tea out of those blue cups[SEP]when I was a little girl, sometimes in the queerest lodgings, and[SEP]sometimes on a trunk at the theatre—queer theatres, for that matter.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]It was a wonderful little dinner.[SEP]There was watercress soup, and sole,[SEP]and a delightful omelette stuffed with mushrooms and truffles, and two[SEP]small rare ducklings, and artichokes, and a dry yellow Rhone wine of[SEP]which Bartley had always been very fond.[SEP]He drank it appreciatively and[SEP]remarked that there was still no other he liked so well.[EOT]
[SOT]“I have some champagne for you, too.[SEP]I don’t drink it myself, but I[SEP]like to see it behave when it’s poured.[SEP]There is nothing else that[SEP]looks so jolly.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Thank you.[SEP]But I don’t like it so well as this.[SEP]” Bartley held the[SEP]yellow wine against the light and squinted into it as he turned the[SEP]glass slowly about.[SEP]“You have traveled, you say.[SEP]Have you been in Paris[SEP]much these late years?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda lowered one of the candle-shades carefully.[SEP]“Oh, yes, I go over[SEP]to Paris often.[SEP]There are few changes in the old Quarter.[SEP]Dear old[SEP]Madame Anger is dead—but perhaps you don’t remember her?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Don’t I, though![SEP]I’m so sorry to hear it.[SEP]How did her son turn out?[SEP]I[SEP]remember how she saved and scraped for him, and how he always lay abed[SEP]till ten o’clock.[SEP]He was the laziest fellow at the Beaux Arts; and[SEP]that’s saying a good deal.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, he is still clever and lazy.[SEP]They say he is a good architect[SEP]when he will work.[SEP]He’s a big, handsome creature, and he hates[SEP]Americans as much as ever.[SEP]But Angel—do you remember Angel?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Perfectly.[SEP]Did she ever get back to Brittany and her _bains de mer?[SEP]_”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah, no.[SEP]Poor Angel![SEP]She got tired of cooking and scouring the coppers[SEP]in Madame Anger’s little kitchen, so she ran away with a soldier, and[SEP]then with another soldier.[SEP]Too bad![SEP]She still lives about the Quarter,[SEP]and, though there is always a _soldat_, she has become a _blanchisseuse[SEP]de fin_.[SEP]She did my blouses beautifully the last time I was there, and[SEP]was so delighted to see me again.[SEP]I gave her all my old clothes, even[SEP]my old hats, though she always wears her Breton headdress.[SEP]Her hair is[SEP]still like flax, and her blue eyes are just like a baby’s, and she has[SEP]the same three freckles on her little nose, and talks about going back[SEP]to her _bains de mer_.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley looked at Hilda across the yellow light of the candles and[SEP]broke into a low, happy laugh.[SEP]“How jolly it was being young, Hilda![SEP]Do[SEP]you remember that first walk we took together in Paris?[SEP]We walked down[SEP]to the Place Saint-Michel to buy some lilacs.[SEP]Do you remember how sweet[SEP]they smelled?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Indeed I do.[SEP]Come, we’ll have our coffee in the other room, and you[SEP]can smoke.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda rose quickly, as if she wished to change the drift of their talk,[SEP]but Bartley found it pleasant to continue it.[EOT]
[SOT]“What a warm, soft spring evening that was,” he went on, as they sat[SEP]down in the study with the coffee on a little table between them; “and[SEP]the sky, over the bridges, was just the color of the lilacs.[SEP]We walked[SEP]on down by the river, didn’t we?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda laughed and looked at him questioningly.[SEP]He saw a gleam in her[SEP]eyes that he remembered even better than the episode he was recalling.[EOT]
[SOT]“I think we did,” she answered demurely.[SEP]“It was on the Quai we met[SEP]that woman who was crying so bitterly.[SEP]I gave her a spray of lilac, I[SEP]remember, and you gave her a franc.[SEP]I was frightened at your[SEP]prodigality.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I expect it was the last franc I had.[SEP]What a strong brown face she[SEP]had, and very tragic.[SEP]She looked at us with such despair and longing,[SEP]out from under her black shawl.[SEP]What she wanted from us was neither our[SEP]flowers nor our francs, but just our youth.[SEP]I remember it touched me[SEP]so.[SEP]I would have given her some of mine off my back, if I could.[SEP]I had[SEP]enough and to spare then,” Bartley mused, and looked thoughtfully at[SEP]his cigar.[EOT]
[SOT]They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the[SEP]money: “God give you a happy love![SEP]” It was not in the ingratiating tone[SEP]of the habitual beggar: it had come out of the depths of the poor[SEP]creature’s sorrow, vibrating with pity for their youth and despair at[SEP]the terribleness of human life; it had the anguish of a voice of[SEP]prophecy.[SEP]Until she spoke, Bartley had not realized that he was in[SEP]love.[SEP]The strange woman, and her passionate sentence that rang out so[SEP]sharply, had frightened them both.[SEP]They went home sadly with the[SEP]lilacs, back to the Rue Saint-Jacques, walking very slowly, arm in arm.[SEP]When they reached the house where Hilda lodged, Bartley went across the[SEP]court with her, and up the dark old stairs to the third landing; and[SEP]there he had kissed her for the first time.[SEP]He had shut his eyes to[SEP]give him the courage, he remembered, and she had trembled so—[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley started when Hilda rang the little bell beside her.[SEP]“Dear me,[SEP]why did you do that?[SEP]I had quite forgotten—I was back there.[SEP]It was[SEP]very jolly,” he murmured lazily, as Marie came in to take away the[SEP]coffee.[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda laughed and went over to the piano.[SEP]“Well, we are neither of us[SEP]twenty now, you know.[SEP]Have I told you about my new play?[SEP]Mac is writing[SEP]one; really for me this time.[SEP]You see, I’m coming on.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ve seen nothing else.[SEP]What kind of a part is it?[SEP]Shall you wear[SEP]yellow gowns?[SEP]I hope so.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He was looking at her round slender figure, as she stood by the piano,[SEP]turning over a pile of music, and he felt the energy in every line of[SEP]it.[EOT]
[SOT]“No, it isn’t a dress-up part.[SEP]He doesn’t seem to fancy me in fine[SEP]feathers.[SEP]He says I ought to be minding the pigs at home, and I suppose[SEP]I ought.[SEP]But he’s given me some good Irish songs.[SEP]Listen.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She sat down at the piano and sang.[SEP]When she finished, Alexander shook[SEP]himself out of a reverie.[EOT]
[SOT]“Sing ‘The Harp That Once,’ Hilda.[SEP]You used to sing it so well.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Nonsense.[SEP]Of course I can’t really sing, except the way my mother and[SEP]grandmother did before me.[SEP]Most actresses nowadays learn to sing[SEP]properly, so I tried a master; but he confused me, just![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander laughed.[SEP]“All the same, sing it, Hilda.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda started up from the stool and moved restlessly toward the window.[SEP]“It’s really too warm in this room to sing.[SEP]Don’t you feel it?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander went over and opened the window for her.[SEP]“Aren’t you afraid[SEP]to let the wind low like that on your neck?[SEP]Can’t I get a scarf or[SEP]something?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ask a theatre lady if she’s afraid of drafts![SEP]” Hilda laughed.[SEP]“But[SEP]perhaps, as I’m so warm—give me your handkerchief.[SEP]There, just in[SEP]front.[SEP]” He slipped the corners carefully under her shoulder-straps.[SEP]“There, that will do.[SEP]It looks like a bib.[SEP]” She pushed his hand away[SEP]quickly and stood looking out into the deserted square.[SEP]“Isn’t London a[SEP]tomb on Sunday night?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander caught the agitation in her voice.[SEP]He stood a little behind[SEP]her, and tried to steady himself as he said: “It’s soft and misty.[SEP]See[SEP]how white the stars are.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]For a long time neither Hilda nor Bartley spoke.[SEP]They stood close[SEP]together, looking out into the wan, watery sky, breathing always more[SEP]quickly and lightly, and it seemed as if all the clocks in the world[SEP]had stopped.[SEP]Suddenly he moved the clenched hand he held behind him and[SEP]dropped it violently at his side.[SEP]He felt a tremor run through the[SEP]slender yellow figure in front of him.[EOT]
[SOT]She caught his handkerchief from her throat and thrust it at him[SEP]without turning round.[SEP]“Here, take it.[SEP]You must go now, Bartley.[SEP]Good-night.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley leaned over her shoulder, without touching her, and whispered[SEP]in her ear: “You are giving me a chance?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes.[SEP]Take it and go.[SEP]This isn’t fair, you know.[SEP]Good-night.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander unclenched the two hands at his sides.[SEP]With one he threw down[SEP]the window and with the other—still standing behind her—he drew her[SEP]back against him.[EOT]
[SOT]She uttered a little cry, threw her arms over her head, and drew his[SEP]face down to hers.[SEP]“Are you going to let me love you a little,[SEP]Bartley?[SEP]” she whispered.[EOT]
[SOT]It was the afternoon of the day before Christmas.[SEP]Mrs.[SEP]Alexander had[SEP]been driving about all the morning, leaving presents at the houses of[SEP]her friends.[SEP]She lunched alone, and as she rose from the table she[SEP]spoke to the butler: “Thomas, I am going down to the kitchen now to see[SEP]Norah.[SEP]In half an hour you are to bring the greens up from the cellar[SEP]and put them in the library.[SEP]Mr. Alexander will be home at three to[SEP]hang them himself.[SEP]Don’t forget the stepladder, and plenty of tacks and[SEP]string.[SEP]You may bring the azaleas upstairs.[SEP]Take the white one to Mr.[SEP]Alexander’s study.[SEP]Put the two pink ones in this room, and the red one[SEP]in the drawing-room.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]A little before three o’clock Mrs.[SEP]Alexander went into the library to[SEP]see that everything was ready.[SEP]She pulled the window shades high, for[SEP]the weather was dark and stormy, and there was little light, even in[SEP]the streets.[SEP]A foot of snow had fallen during the morning, and the wide[SEP]space over the river was thick with flying flakes that fell and[SEP]wreathed the masses of floating ice.[SEP]Winifred was standing by the[SEP]window when she heard the front door open.[SEP]She hurried to the hall as[SEP]Alexander came stamping in, covered with snow.[SEP]He kissed her joyfully[SEP]and brushed away the snow that fell on her hair.[EOT]
[SOT]“I wish I had asked you to meet me at the office and walk home with me,[SEP]Winifred.[SEP]The Common is beautiful.[SEP]The boys have swept the snow off the[SEP]pond and are skating furiously.[SEP]Did the cyclamens come?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“An hour ago.[SEP]What splendid ones![SEP]But aren’t you frightfully[SEP]extravagant?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Not for Christmas-time.[SEP]I’ll go upstairs and change my coat.[SEP]I shall[SEP]be down in a moment.[SEP]Tell Thomas to get everything ready.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]When Alexander reappeared, he took his wife’s arm and went with her[SEP]into the library.[SEP]“When did the azaleas get here?[SEP]Thomas has got the[SEP]white one in my room.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I told him to put it there.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But, I say, it’s much the finest of the lot![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s why I had it put there.[SEP]There is too much color in that room[SEP]for a red one, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley began to sort the greens.[SEP]“It looks very splendid there, but I[SEP]feel piggish to have it.[SEP]However, we really spend more time there than[SEP]anywhere else in the house.[SEP]Will you hand me the holly?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He climbed up the stepladder, which creaked under his weight, and began[SEP]to twist the tough stems of the holly into the frame-work of the[SEP]chandelier.[EOT]
[SOT]“I forgot to tell you that I had a letter from Wilson, this morning,[SEP]explaining his telegram.[SEP]He is coming on because an old uncle up in[SEP]Vermont has conveniently died and left Wilson a little money—something[SEP]like ten thousand.[SEP]He’s coming on to settle up the estate.[SEP]Won’t it be[SEP]jolly to have him?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And how fine that he’s come into a little money.[SEP]I can see him posting[SEP]down State Street to the steamship offices.[SEP]He will get a good many[SEP]trips out of that ten thousand.[SEP]What can have detained him?[SEP]I expected[SEP]him here for luncheon.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Those trains from Albany are always late.[SEP]He’ll be along sometime this[SEP]afternoon.[SEP]And now, don’t you want to go upstairs and lie down for an[SEP]hour?[SEP]You’ve had a busy morning and I don’t want you to be tired[SEP]to-night.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]After his wife went upstairs Alexander worked energetically at the[SEP]greens for a few moments.[SEP]Then, as he was cutting off a length of[SEP]string, he sighed suddenly and sat down, staring out of the window at[SEP]the snow.[SEP]The animation died out of his face, but in his eyes there was[SEP]a restless light, a look of apprehension and suspense.[SEP]He kept clasping[SEP]and unclasping his big hands as if he were trying to realize something.[SEP]The clock ticked through the minutes of a half-hour and the afternoon[SEP]outside began to thicken and darken turbidly.[SEP]Alexander, since he first[SEP]sat down, had not changed his position.[SEP]He leaned forward, his hands[SEP]between his knees, scarcely breathing, as if he were holding himself[SEP]away from his surroundings, from the room, and from the very chair in[SEP]which he sat, from everything except the wild eddies of snow above the[SEP]river on which his eyes were fixed with feverish intentness, as if he[SEP]were trying to project himself thither.[SEP]When at last Lucius Wilson was[SEP]announced, Alexander sprang eagerly to his feet and hurried to meet his[SEP]old instructor.[EOT]
[SOT]“Hello, Wilson.[SEP]What luck![SEP]Come into the library.[SEP]We are to have a lot[SEP]of people to dinner to-night, and Winifred’s lying down.[SEP]You will[SEP]excuse her, won’t you?[SEP]And now what about yourself?[SEP]Sit down and tell[SEP]me everything.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I think I’d rather move about, if you don’t mind.[SEP]I’ve been sitting in[SEP]the train for a week, it seems to me.[SEP]” Wilson stood before the fire[SEP]with his hands behind him and looked about the room.[SEP]“You _have_ been[SEP]busy.[SEP]Bartley, if I’d had my choice of all possible places in which to[SEP]spend Christmas, your house would certainly be the place I’d have[SEP]chosen.[SEP]Happy people do a great deal for their friends.[SEP]A house like[SEP]this throws its warmth out.[SEP]I felt it distinctly as I was coming[SEP]through the Berkshires.[SEP]I could scarcely believe that I was to see Mrs.[SEP]Bartley again so soon.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Thank you, Wilson.[SEP]She’ll be as glad to see you.[SEP]Shall we have tea[SEP]now?[SEP]I’ll ring for Thomas to clear away this litter.[SEP]Winifred says I[SEP]always wreck the house when I try to do anything.[SEP]Do you know, I am[SEP]quite tired.[SEP]Looks as if I were not used to work, doesn’t it?[SEP]”[SEP]Alexander laughed and dropped into a chair.[SEP]“You know, I’m sailing the[SEP]day after New Year’s.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Again?[SEP]Why, you’ve been over twice since I was here in the spring,[SEP]haven’t you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, I was in London about ten days in the summer.[SEP]Went to escape the[SEP]hot weather more than anything else.[SEP]I shan’t be gone more than a month[SEP]this time.[SEP]Winifred and I have been up in Canada for most of the[SEP]autumn.[SEP]That Moorlock Bridge is on my back all the time.[SEP]I never had so[SEP]much trouble with a job before.[SEP]” Alexander moved about restlessly and[SEP]fell to poking the fire.[EOT]
[SOT]“Haven’t I seen in the papers that there is some trouble about a[SEP]tidewater bridge of yours in New Jersey?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, that doesn’t amount to anything.[SEP]It’s held up by a steel strike.[SEP]A[SEP]bother, of course, but the sort of thing one is always having to put up[SEP]with.[SEP]But the Moorlock Bridge is a continual anxiety.[SEP]You see, the[SEP]truth is, we are having to build pretty well to the strain limit up[SEP]there.[SEP]They’ve crowded me too much on the cost.[SEP]It’s all very well if[SEP]everything goes well, but these estimates have never been used for[SEP]anything of such length before.[SEP]However, there’s nothing to be done.[SEP]They hold me to the scale I’ve used in shorter bridges.[SEP]The last thing[SEP]a bridge commission cares about is the kind of bridge you build.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]When Bartley had finished dressing for dinner he went into his study,[SEP]where he found his wife arranging flowers on his writing-table.[EOT]
[SOT]“These pink roses just came from Mrs.[SEP]Hastings,” she said, smiling,[SEP]“and I am sure she meant them for you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley looked about with an air of satisfaction at the greens and the[SEP]wreaths in the windows.[SEP]“Have you a moment, Winifred?[SEP]I have just now[SEP]been thinking that this is our twelfth Christmas.[SEP]Can you realize it?[SEP]”[SEP]He went up to the table and took her hands away from the flowers,[SEP]drying them with his pocket handkerchief.[SEP]“They’ve been awfully happy[SEP]ones, all of them, haven’t they?[SEP]” He took her in his arms and bent[SEP]back, lifting her a little and giving her a long kiss.[SEP]“You are happy,[SEP]aren’t you Winifred?[SEP]More than anything else in the world, I want you[SEP]to be happy.[SEP]Sometimes, of late, I’ve thought you looked as if you were[SEP]troubled.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No; it’s only when you are troubled and harassed that I feel worried,[SEP]Bartley.[SEP]I wish you always seemed as you do to-night.[SEP]But you don’t,[SEP]always.[SEP]” She looked earnestly and inquiringly into his eyes.[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander took her two hands from his shoulders and swung them back and[SEP]forth in his own, laughing his big blond laugh.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m growing older, my dear; that’s what you feel.[SEP]Now, may I show you[SEP]something?[SEP]I meant to save them until to-morrow, but I want you to wear[SEP]them to-night.[SEP]” He took a little leather box out of his pocket and[SEP]opened it.[SEP]On the white velvet lay two long pendants of curiously[SEP]worked gold, set with pearls.[SEP]Winifred looked from the box to Bartley[SEP]and exclaimed:—[EOT]
[SOT]“Where did you ever find such gold work, Bartley?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s old Flemish.[SEP]Isn’t it fine?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“They are the most beautiful things, dear.[SEP]But, you know, I never wear[SEP]earrings.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, yes, I know.[SEP]But I want you to wear them.[SEP]I have always wanted[SEP]you to.[SEP]So few women can.[SEP]There must be a good ear, to begin with, and[SEP]a nose”—he waved his hand—“above reproach.[SEP]Most women look silly in[SEP]them.[SEP]They go only with faces like yours—very, very proud, and just a[SEP]little hard.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Winifred laughed as she went over to the mirror and fitted the delicate[SEP]springs to the lobes of her ears.[SEP]“Oh, Bartley, that old foolishness[SEP]about my being hard.[SEP]It really hurts my feelings.[SEP]But I must go down[SEP]now.[SEP]People are beginning to come.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley drew her arm about his neck and went to the door with her.[SEP]“Not[SEP]hard to me, Winifred,” he whispered.[SEP]“Never, never hard to me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Left alone, he paced up and down his study.[SEP]He was at home again, among[SEP]all the dear familiar things that spoke to him of so many happy years.[SEP]His house to-night would be full of charming people, who liked and[SEP]admired him.[SEP]Yet all the time, underneath his pleasure and hopefulness[SEP]and satisfaction, he was conscious of the vibration of an unnatural[SEP]excitement.[SEP]Amid this light and warmth and friendliness, he sometimes[SEP]started and shuddered, as if some one had stepped on his grave.[SEP]Something had broken loose in him of which he knew nothing except that[SEP]it was sullen and powerful, and that it wrung and tortured him.[SEP]Sometimes it came upon him softly, in enervating reveries.[SEP]Sometimes it[SEP]battered him like the cannon rolling in the hold of the vessel.[SEP]Always,[SEP]now, it brought with it a sense of quickened life, of stimulating[SEP]danger.[SEP]To-night it came upon him suddenly, as he was walking the[SEP]floor, after his wife left him.[SEP]It seemed impossible; he could not[SEP]believe it.[SEP]He glanced entreatingly at the door, as if to call her[SEP]back.[SEP]He heard voices in the hall below, and knew that he must go down.[SEP]Going over to the window, he looked out at the lights across the river.[SEP]How could this happen here, in his own house, among the things he[SEP]loved?[SEP]What was it that reached in out of the darkness and thrilled[SEP]him?[SEP]As he stood there he had a feeling that he would never escape.[SEP]He[SEP]shut his eyes and pressed his forehead against the cold window glass,[SEP]breathing in the chill that came through it.[SEP]“That this,” he groaned,[SEP]“that this should have happened to _me![SEP]_”[EOT]
[SOT]On New Year’s day a thaw set in, and during the night torrents of rain[SEP]fell.[SEP]In the morning, the morning of Alexander’s departure for England,[SEP]the river was streaked with fog and the rain drove hard against the[SEP]windows of the breakfast-room.[SEP]Alexander had finished his coffee and[SEP]was pacing up and down.[SEP]His wife sat at the table, watching him.[SEP]She[SEP]was pale and unnaturally calm.[SEP]When Thomas brought the letters, Bartley[SEP]sank into his chair and ran them over rapidly.[EOT]
[SOT]“Here’s a note from old Wilson.[SEP]He’s safe back at his grind, and says[SEP]he had a bully time.[SEP]‘The memory of Mrs.[SEP]Bartley will make my whole[SEP]winter fragrant.[SEP]’ Just like him.[SEP]He will go on getting measureless[SEP]satisfaction out of you by his study fire.[SEP]What a man he is for looking[SEP]on at life![SEP]” Bartley sighed, pushed the letters back impatiently, and[SEP]went over to the window.[SEP]“This is a nasty sort of day to sail.[SEP]I’ve a[SEP]notion to call it off.[SEP]Next week would be time enough.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That would only mean starting twice.[SEP]It wouldn’t really help you out[SEP]at all,” Mrs.[SEP]Alexander spoke soothingly.[SEP]“And you’d come back late for[SEP]all your engagements.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley began jingling some loose coins in his pocket.[SEP]“I wish things[SEP]would let me rest.[SEP]I’m tired of work, tired of people, tired of[SEP]trailing about.[SEP]” He looked out at the storm-beaten river.[EOT]
[SOT]Winifred came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder.[SEP]“That’s[SEP]what you always say, poor Bartley![SEP]At bottom you really like all these[SEP]things.[SEP]Can’t you remember that?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He put his arm about her.[SEP]“All the same, life runs smoothly enough with[SEP]some people, and with me it’s always a messy sort of patchwork.[SEP]It’s[SEP]like the song; peace is where I am not.[SEP]How can you face it all with so[SEP]much fortitude?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She looked at him with that clear gaze which Wilson had so much[SEP]admired, which he had felt implied such high confidence and fearless[SEP]pride.[SEP]“Oh, I faced that long ago, when you were on your first bridge,[SEP]up at old Allway.[SEP]I knew then that your paths were not to be paths of[SEP]peace, but I decided that I wanted to follow them.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley and his wife stood silent for a long time; the fire crackled in[SEP]the grate, the rain beat insistently upon the windows, and the sleepy[SEP]Angora looked up at them curiously.[EOT]
[SOT]Presently Thomas made a discreet sound at the door.[SEP]“Shall Edward bring[SEP]down your trunks, sir?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes; they are ready.[SEP]Tell him not to forget the big portfolio on the[SEP]study table.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Thomas withdrew, closing the door softly.[SEP]Bartley turned away from his[SEP]wife, still holding her hand.[SEP]“It never gets any easier, Winifred.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]They both started at the sound of the carriage on the pavement outside.[SEP]Alexander sat down and leaned his head on his hand.[SEP]His wife bent over[SEP]him.[SEP]“Courage,” she said gayly.[SEP]Bartley rose and rang the bell.[SEP]Thomas[SEP]brought him his hat and stick and ulster.[SEP]At the sight of these, the[SEP]supercilious Angora moved restlessly, quitted her red cushion by the[SEP]fire, and came up, waving her tail in vexation at these ominous[SEP]indications of change.[SEP]Alexander stooped to stroke her, and then[SEP]plunged into his coat and drew on his gloves.[SEP]His wife held his stick,[SEP]smiling.[SEP]Bartley smiled too, and his eyes cleared.[SEP]“I’ll work like the[SEP]devil, Winifred, and be home again before you realize I’ve gone.[SEP]” He[SEP]kissed her quickly several times, hurried out of the front door into[SEP]the rain, and waved to her from the carriage window as the driver was[SEP]starting his melancholy, dripping black horses.[SEP]Alexander sat with his[SEP]hands clenched on his knees.[SEP]As the carriage turned up the hill, he[SEP]lifted one hand and brought it down violently.[SEP]“This time”—he spoke[SEP]aloud and through his set teeth—“this time I’m going to end it![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]On the afternoon of the third day out, Alexander was sitting well to[SEP]the stern, on the windward side where the chairs were few, his rugs[SEP]over him and the collar of his fur-lined coat turned up about his ears.[SEP]The weather had so far been dark and raw.[SEP]For two hours he had been[SEP]watching the low, dirty sky and the beating of the heavy rain upon the[SEP]iron-colored sea.[SEP]There was a long, oily swell that made exercise[SEP]laborious.[SEP]The decks smelled of damp woolens, and the air was so humid[SEP]that drops of moisture kept gathering upon his hair and mustache.[SEP]He[SEP]seldom moved except to brush them away.[SEP]The great open spaces made him[SEP]passive and the restlessness of the water quieted him.[SEP]He intended[SEP]during the voyage to decide upon a course of action, but he held all[SEP]this away from him for the present and lay in a blessed gray oblivion.[SEP]Deep down in him somewhere his resolution was weakening and[SEP]strengthening, ebbing and flowing.[SEP]The thing that perturbed him went on[SEP]as steadily as his pulse, but he was almost unconscious of it.[SEP]He was[SEP]submerged in the vast impersonal grayness about him, and at intervals[SEP]the sidelong roll of the boat measured off time like the ticking of a[SEP]clock.[SEP]He felt released from everything that troubled and perplexed[SEP]him.[SEP]It was as if he had tricked and outwitted torturing memories, had[SEP]actually managed to get on board without them.[SEP]He thought of nothing at[SEP]all.[SEP]If his mind now and again picked a face out of the grayness, it[SEP]was Lucius Wilson’s, or the face of an old schoolmate, forgotten for[SEP]years; or it was the slim outline of a favorite greyhound he used to[SEP]hunt jack-rabbits with when he was a boy.[EOT]
[SOT]Toward six o’clock the wind rose and tugged at the tarpaulin and[SEP]brought the swell higher.[SEP]After dinner Alexander came back to the wet[SEP]deck, piled his damp rugs over him again, and sat smoking, losing[SEP]himself in the obliterating blackness and drowsing in the rush of the[SEP]gale.[SEP]Before he went below a few bright stars were pricked off between[SEP]heavily moving masses of cloud.[EOT]
[SOT]The next morning was bright and mild, with a fresh breeze.[SEP]Alexander[SEP]felt the need of exercise even before he came out of his cabin.[SEP]When he[SEP]went on deck the sky was blue and blinding, with heavy whiffs of white[SEP]cloud, smoke-colored at the edges, moving rapidly across it.[SEP]The water[SEP]was roughish, a cold, clear indigo breaking into whitecaps.[SEP]Bartley[SEP]walked for two hours, and then stretched himself in the sun until[SEP]lunch-time.[EOT]
[SOT]In the afternoon he wrote a long letter to Winifred.[SEP]Later, as he[SEP]walked the deck through a splendid golden sunset, his spirits rose[SEP]continually.[SEP]It was agreeable to come to himself again after several[SEP]days of numbness and torpor.[SEP]He stayed out until the last tinge of[SEP]violet had faded from the water.[SEP]There was literally a taste of life on[SEP]his lips as he sat down to dinner and ordered a bottle of champagne.[SEP]He[SEP]was late in finishing his dinner, and drank rather more wine than he[SEP]had meant to.[SEP]When he went above, the wind had risen and the deck was[SEP]almost deserted.[SEP]As he stepped out of the door a gale lifted his heavy[SEP]fur coat about his shoulders.[SEP]He fought his way up the deck with keen[SEP]exhilaration.[SEP]The moment he stepped, almost out of breath, behind the[SEP]shelter of the stern, the wind was cut off, and he felt, like a rush of[SEP]warm air, a sense of close and intimate companionship.[SEP]He started back[SEP]and tore his coat open as if something warm were actually clinging to[SEP]him beneath it.[SEP]He hurried up the deck and went into the saloon parlor,[SEP]full of women who had retreated thither from the sharp wind.[SEP]He threw[SEP]himself upon them.[SEP]He talked delightfully to the older ones and played[SEP]accompaniments for the younger ones until the last sleepy girl had[SEP]followed her mother below.[SEP]Then he went into the smoking-room.[SEP]He[SEP]played bridge until two o’clock in the morning, and managed to lose a[SEP]considerable sum of money without really noticing that he was doing so.[EOT]
[SOT]After the break of one fine day the weather was pretty consistently[SEP]dull.[SEP]When the low sky thinned a trifle, the pale white spot of a sun[SEP]did no more than throw a bluish lustre on the water, giving it the dark[SEP]brightness of newly cut lead.[SEP]Through one after another of those gray[SEP]days Alexander drowsed and mused, drinking in the grateful moisture.[SEP]But the complete peace of the first part of the voyage was over.[SEP]Sometimes he rose suddenly from his chair as if driven out, and paced[SEP]the deck for hours.[SEP]People noticed his propensity for walking in rough[SEP]weather, and watched him curiously as he did his rounds.[SEP]From his[SEP]abstraction and the determined set of his jaw, they fancied he must be[SEP]thinking about his bridge.[SEP]Every one had heard of the new cantilever[SEP]bridge in Canada.[EOT]
[SOT]But Alexander was not thinking about his work.[SEP]After the fourth night[SEP]out, when his will suddenly softened under his hands, he had been[SEP]continually hammering away at himself.[SEP]More and more often, when he[SEP]first wakened in the morning or when he stepped into a warm place after[SEP]being chilled on the deck, he felt a sudden painful delight at being[SEP]nearer another shore.[SEP]Sometimes when he was most despondent, when he[SEP]thought himself worn out with this struggle, in a flash he was free of[SEP]it and leaped into an overwhelming consciousness of himself.[SEP]On the[SEP]instant he felt that marvelous return of the impetuousness, the intense[SEP]excitement, the increasing expectancy of youth.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER VI[EOT]
[SOT]The last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable.[SEP]The[SEP]stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that[SEP]he noted dimly through his growing impatience.[SEP]He had planned to stop[SEP]in Liverpool; but, instead, he took the boat train for London.[EOT]
[SOT]Emerging at Euston at half-past three o’clock in the afternoon,[SEP]Alexander had his luggage sent to the Savoy and drove at once to[SEP]Bedford Square.[SEP]When Marie met him at the door, even her strong sense[SEP]of the proprieties could not restrain her surprise and delight.[SEP]She[SEP]blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran[SEP]upstairs.[SEP]Alexander paced up and down the hallway, buttoning and[SEP]unbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to Hilda’s[SEP]living-room.[SEP]The room was empty when he entered.[SEP]A coal fire was[SEP]crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already[SEP]beginning to grow dark outside.[SEP]Alexander did not sit down.[SEP]He stood[SEP]his ground over by the windows until Hilda came in.[SEP]She called his name[SEP]on the threshold, but in her swift flight across the room she felt a[SEP]change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell[SEP]just when she did it.[SEP]She merely brushed his cheek with her lips and[SEP]put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder.[SEP]“Oh, what a grand[SEP]thing to happen on a raw day![SEP]I felt it in my bones when I woke this[SEP]morning that something splendid was going to turn up.[SEP]I thought it[SEP]might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along.[SEP]I never[SEP]dreamed it would be you, Bartley.[SEP]But why do you let me chatter on like[SEP]this?[SEP]Come over to the fire; you’re chilled through.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire, and sat down on a[SEP]stool at the opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her[SEP]chin, laughing like a happy little girl.[EOT]
[SOT]“When did you come, Bartley, and how did it happen?[SEP]You haven’t spoken[SEP]a word.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I got in about ten minutes ago.[SEP]I landed at Liverpool this morning and[SEP]came down on the boat train.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.[SEP]Hilda[SEP]watched him with perplexity.[EOT]
[SOT]“There’s something troubling you, Bartley.[SEP]What is it?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley bent lower over the fire.[SEP]“It’s the whole thing that troubles[SEP]me, Hilda.[SEP]You and I.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda took a quick, soft breath.[SEP]She looked at his heavy shoulders and[SEP]big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash.[EOT]
[SOT]“What about us, Bartley?[SEP]” she asked in a thin voice.[EOT]
[SOT]He locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers[SEP]close to the bluish flame, while the coals crackled and the clock[SEP]ticked and a street vendor began to call under the window.[SEP]At last[SEP]Alexander brought out one word:—[EOT]
[SOT]“Everything![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda was pale by this time, and her eyes were wide with fright.[SEP]She[SEP]looked about desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows,[SEP]and back again to Bartley.[SEP]She rose uncertainly, touched his hair with[SEP]her hand, then sank back upon her stool.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ll do anything you wish me to, Bartley,” she said tremulously.[SEP]“I[SEP]can’t stand seeing you miserable.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I can’t live with myself any longer,” he answered roughly.[EOT]
[SOT]He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably[SEP]about the room, seeming to find it too small for him.[SEP]He pulled up a[SEP]window as if the air were heavy.[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda watched him from her corner, trembling and scarcely breathing,[SEP]dark shadows growing about her eyes.[EOT]
[SOT]“It .[SEP].[SEP].[SEP]it hasn’t always made you miserable, has it?[SEP]” Her eyelids[SEP]fell and her lips quivered.[EOT]
[SOT]“Always.[SEP]But it’s worse now.[SEP]It’s unbearable.[SEP]It tortures me every[SEP]minute.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But why _now?[SEP]_” she asked piteously, wringing her hands.[EOT]
[SOT]He ignored her question.[SEP]“I am not a man who can live two lives,” he[SEP]went on feverishly.[SEP]“Each life spoils the other.[SEP]I get nothing but[SEP]misery out of either.[SEP]The world is all there, just as it used to be,[SEP]but I can’t get at it any more.[SEP]There is this deception between me and[SEP]everything.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]At that word “deception,” spoken with such self-contempt, the color[SEP]flashed back into Hilda’s face as suddenly as if she had been struck by[SEP]a whiplash.[SEP]She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were[SEP]clasped tightly in front of her.[EOT]
[SOT]“Could you—could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if[SEP]I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire.[SEP]“It was myself I[SEP]was defying, Hilda.[SEP]I have thought about it until I am worn out.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He looked at her and his haggard face softened.[SEP]He put out his hand[SEP]toward her as he looked away again into the fire.[EOT]
[SOT]She crept across to him, drawing her stool after her.[SEP]“When did you[SEP]first begin to feel like this, Bartley?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“After the very first.[SEP]The first was—sort of in play, wasn’t it?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda’s face quivered, but she whispered: “Yes, I think it must have[SEP]been.[SEP]But why didn’t you tell me when you were here in the summer?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander groaned.[SEP]“I meant to, but somehow I couldn’t.[SEP]We had only a[SEP]few days, and your new play was just on, and you were so happy.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, I was happy, wasn’t I?[SEP]” She pressed his hand gently in gratitude.[SEP]“Weren’t you happy then, at all?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the[SEP]fragrance of those days.[SEP]Something of their troubling sweetness came[SEP]back to Alexander, too.[SEP]He moved uneasily and his chair creaked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, I was then.[SEP]You know.[SEP]But afterward.[SEP].[SEP].[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, yes,” she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him.[SEP]Presently it stole back to his coat sleeve.[SEP]“Please tell me one thing,[SEP]Bartley.[SEP]At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you[SEP]happy.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]His hand shut down quickly over the questioning fingers on his sleeves.[SEP]“Yes, Hilda; I know that,” he said simply.[EOT]
[SOT]She leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly:—[EOT]
[SOT]“You see, my mistake was in wanting you to have everything.[SEP]I wanted[SEP]you to eat all the cakes and have them, too.[SEP]I somehow believed that I[SEP]could take all the bad consequences for you.[SEP]I wanted you always to be[SEP]happy and handsome and successful—to have all the things that a great[SEP]man ought to have, and, once in a way, the careless holidays that great[SEP]men are not permitted.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the[SEP]deepening lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much[SEP]longer struggle together.[EOT]
[SOT]“I understand, Bartley.[SEP]I was wrong.[SEP]But I didn’t know.[SEP]You’ve only to[SEP]tell me now.[SEP]What must I do that I’ve not done, or what must I not do?[SEP]”[SEP]She listened intently, but she heard nothing but the creaking of his[SEP]chair.[SEP]“You want me to say it?[SEP]” she whispered.[SEP]“You want to tell me[SEP]that you can only see me like this, as old friends do, or out in the[SEP]world among people?[SEP]I can do that.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I can’t,” he said heavily.[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda shivered and sat still.[SEP]Bartley leaned his head in his hands and[SEP]spoke through his teeth.[SEP]“It’s got to be a clean break, Hilda.[SEP]I can’t[SEP]see you at all, anywhere.[SEP]What I mean is that I want you to promise[SEP]never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I[SEP]beg.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda sprang up like a flame.[SEP]She stood over him with her hands[SEP]clenched at her side, her body rigid.[EOT]
[SOT]“No![SEP]” she gasped.[SEP]“It’s too late to ask that.[SEP]Do you hear me, Bartley?[SEP]It’s too late.[SEP]I won’t promise.[SEP]It’s abominable of you to ask me.[SEP]Keep[SEP]away if you wish; when have I ever followed you?[SEP]But, if you come to[SEP]me, I’ll do as I see fit.[SEP]The shamefulness of your asking me to do[SEP]that![SEP]If you come to me, I’ll do as I see fit.[SEP]Do you understand?[SEP]Bartley, you’re cowardly![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander rose and shook himself angrily.[SEP]“Yes, I know I’m cowardly.[SEP]I’m afraid of myself.[SEP]I don’t trust myself any more.[SEP]I carried it all[SEP]lightly enough at first, but now I don’t dare trifle with it.[SEP]It’s[SEP]getting the better of me.[SEP]It’s different now.[SEP]I’m growing older, and[SEP]you’ve got my young self here with you.[SEP]It’s through him that I’ve come[SEP]to wish for you all and all the time.[SEP]” He took her roughly in his arms.[SEP]“Do you know what I mean?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly.[SEP]“Oh,[SEP]Bartley, what am I to do?[SEP]Why didn’t you let me be angry with you?[SEP]You[SEP]ask me to stay away from you because you want me![SEP]And I’ve got nobody[SEP]but you.[SEP]I will do anything you say—but that![SEP]I will ask the least[SEP]imaginable, but I must have _something![SEP]_”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley turned away and sank down in his chair again.[SEP]Hilda sat on the[SEP]arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders.[EOT]
[SOT]“Just something Bartley.[SEP]I must have you to think of through the months[SEP]and months of loneliness.[SEP]I must see you.[SEP]I must know about you.[SEP]The[SEP]sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful—can I[SEP]never make you understand what that means to me?[SEP]” She pressed his[SEP]shoulders gently.[SEP]“You see, loving some one as I love you makes the[SEP]whole world different.[SEP]If I’d met you later, if I hadn’t loved you so[SEP]well—but that’s all over, long ago.[SEP]Then came all those years without[SEP]you, lonely and hurt and discouraged; those decent young fellows and[SEP]poor Mac, and me never heeding—hard as a steel spring.[SEP]And then you[SEP]came back, not caring very much, but it made no difference.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up[SEP]any longer.[SEP]Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her[SEP]mouth and her wet, tired eyes.[EOT]
[SOT]“Don’t cry, don’t cry,” he whispered.[SEP]“We’ve tortured each other enough[SEP]for tonight.[SEP]Forget everything except that I am here.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I think I have forgotten everything but that already,” she murmured.[SEP]“Ah, your dear arms![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER VII[EOT]
[SOT]During the fortnight that Alexander was in London he drove himself[SEP]hard.[SEP]He got through a great deal of personal business and saw a great[SEP]many men who were doing interesting things in his own profession.[SEP]He[SEP]disliked to think of his visits to London as holidays, and when he was[SEP]there he worked even harder than he did at home.[EOT]
[SOT]The day before his departure for Liverpool was a singularly fine one.[SEP]The thick air had cleared overnight in a strong wind which brought in a[SEP]golden dawn and then fell off to a fresh breeze.[SEP]When Bartley looked[SEP]out of his windows from the Savoy, the river was flashing silver and[SEP]the gray stone along the Embankment was bathed in bright, clear[SEP]sunshine.[SEP]London had wakened to life after three weeks of cold and[SEP]sodden rain.[SEP]Bartley breakfasted hurriedly and went over his mail while[SEP]the hotel valet packed his trunks.[SEP]Then he paid his account and walked[SEP]rapidly down the Strand past Charing Cross Station.[SEP]His spirits rose[SEP]with every step, and when he reached Trafalgar Square, blazing in the[SEP]sun, with its fountains playing and its column reaching up into the[SEP]bright air, he signaled to a hansom, and, before he knew what he was[SEP]about, told the driver to go to Bedford Square by way of the British[SEP]Museum.[EOT]
[SOT]When he reached Hilda’s apartment she met him, fresh as the morning[SEP]itself.[SEP]Her rooms were flooded with sunshine and full of the flowers he[SEP]had been sending her.[SEP]She would never let him give her anything else.[EOT]
[SOT]“Are you busy this morning, Hilda?[SEP]” he asked as he sat down, his hat[SEP]and gloves in his hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“Very.[SEP]I’ve been up and about three hours, working at my part.[SEP]We open[SEP]in February, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, then you’ve worked enough.[SEP]And so have I.[SEP]I’ve seen all my men,[SEP]my packing is done, and I go up to Liverpool this evening.[SEP]But this[SEP]morning we are going to have a holiday.[SEP]What do you say to a drive out[SEP]to Kew and Richmond?[SEP]You may not get another day like this all winter.[SEP]It’s like a fine April day at home.[SEP]May I use your telephone?[SEP]I want to[SEP]order the carriage.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, how jolly![SEP]There, sit down at the desk.[SEP]And while you are[SEP]telephoning I’ll change my dress.[SEP]I shan’t be long.[SEP]All the morning[SEP]papers are on the table.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda was back in a few moments wearing a long gray squirrel coat and a[SEP]broad fur hat.[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley rose and inspected her.[SEP]“Why don’t you wear some of those pink[SEP]roses?[SEP]” he asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“But they came only this morning, and they have not even begun to open.[SEP]I was saving them.[SEP]I am so unconsciously thrifty![SEP]” She laughed as she[SEP]looked about the room.[SEP]“You’ve been sending me far too many flowers,[SEP]Bartley.[SEP]New ones every day.[SEP]That’s too often; though I do love to open[SEP]the boxes, and I take good care of them.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why won’t you let me send you any of those jade or ivory things you[SEP]are so fond of?[SEP]Or pictures?[SEP]I know a good deal about pictures.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda shook her large hat as she drew the roses out of the tall glass.[SEP]“No, there are some things you can’t do.[SEP]There’s the carriage.[SEP]Will you[SEP]button my gloves for me?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bartley took her wrist and began to button the long gray suede glove.[SEP]“How gay your eyes are this morning, Hilda.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s because I’ve been studying.[SEP]It always stirs me up a little.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He pushed the top of the glove up slowly.[SEP]“When did you learn to take[SEP]hold of your parts like that?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“When I had nothing else to think of.[SEP]Come, the carriage is waiting.[SEP]What a shocking while you take.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m in no hurry.[SEP]We’ve plenty of time.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]They found all London abroad.[SEP]Piccadilly was a stream of rapidly moving[SEP]carriages, from which flashed furs and flowers and bright winter[SEP]costumes.[SEP]The metal trappings of the harnesses shone dazzlingly, and[SEP]the wheels were revolving disks that threw off rays of light.[SEP]The parks[SEP]were full of children and nursemaids and joyful dogs that leaped and[SEP]yelped and scratched up the brown earth with their paws.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m not going until to-morrow, you know,” Bartley announced suddenly.[SEP]“I’ll cut off a day in Liverpool.[SEP]I haven’t felt so jolly this long[SEP]while.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda looked up with a smile which she tried not to make too glad.[SEP]“I[SEP]think people were meant to be happy, a little,” she said.[EOT]
[SOT]They had lunch at Richmond and then walked to Twickenham, where they[SEP]had sent the carriage.[SEP]They drove back, with a glorious sunset behind[SEP]them, toward the distant gold-washed city.[SEP]It was one of those rare[SEP]afternoons when all the thickness and shadow of London are changed to a[SEP]kind of shining, pulsing, special atmosphere; when the smoky vapors[SEP]become fluttering golden clouds, nacreous veils of pink and amber; when[SEP]all that bleakness of gray stone and dullness of dirty brick trembles[SEP]in aureate light, and all the roofs and spires, and one great dome, are[SEP]floated in golden haze.[SEP]On such rare afternoons the ugliest of cities[SEP]becomes the most poetic, and months of sodden days are offset by a[SEP]moment of miracle.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s like that with us Londoners, too,” Hilda was saying.[SEP]“Everything[SEP]is awfully grim and cheerless, our weather and our houses and our ways[SEP]of amusing ourselves.[SEP]But we can be happier than anybody.[SEP]We can go mad[SEP]with joy, as the people do out in the fields on a fine Whitsunday.[SEP]We[SEP]make the most of our moment.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She thrust her little chin out defiantly over her gray fur collar, and[SEP]Bartley looked down at her and laughed.[EOT]
[SOT]“You are a plucky one, you.[SEP]” He patted her glove with his hand.[SEP]“Yes,[SEP]you are a plucky one.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda sighed.[SEP]“No, I’m not.[SEP]Not about some things, at any rate.[SEP]It[SEP]doesn’t take pluck to fight for one’s moment, but it takes pluck to go[SEP]without—a lot.[SEP]More than I have.[SEP]I can’t help it,” she added fiercely.[EOT]
[SOT]After miles of outlying streets and little gloomy houses, they reached[SEP]London itself, red and roaring and murky, with a thick dampness coming[SEP]up from the river, that betokened fog again to-morrow.[SEP]The streets were[SEP]full of people who had worked indoors all through the priceless day and[SEP]had now come hungrily out to drink the muddy lees of it.[SEP]They stood in[SEP]long black lines, waiting before the pit entrances of the[SEP]theatres—short-coated boys, and girls in sailor hats, all shivering and[SEP]chatting gayly.[SEP]There was a blurred rhythm in all the dull city[SEP]noises—in the clatter of the cab horses and the rumbling of the busses,[SEP]in the street calls, and in the undulating tramp, tramp of the crowd.[SEP]It was like the deep vibration of some vast underground machinery, and[SEP]like the muffled pulsations of millions of human hearts.[EOT]
[SOT][See “The Barrel Organ by Alfred Noyes.[SEP]Ed.] [I have placed it at the[SEP]end for your convenience][EOT]
[SOT]“Seems good to get back, doesn’t it?[SEP]” Bartley whispered, as they drove[SEP]from Bayswater Road into Oxford Street.[SEP]“London always makes me want to[SEP]live more than any other city in the world.[SEP]You remember our priestess[SEP]mummy over in the mummy-room, and how we used to long to go and bring[SEP]her out on nights like this?[SEP]Three thousand years![SEP]Ugh![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“All the same, I believe she used to feel it when we stood there and[SEP]watched her and wished her well.[SEP]I believe she used to remember,” Hilda[SEP]said thoughtfully.[EOT]
[SOT]“I hope so.[SEP]Now let’s go to some awfully jolly place for dinner before[SEP]we go home.[SEP]I could eat all the dinners there are in London to-night.[SEP]Where shall I tell the driver?[SEP]The Piccadilly Restaurant?[SEP]The music’s[SEP]good there.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“There are too many people there whom one knows.[SEP]Why not that little[SEP]French place in Soho, where we went so often when you were here in the[SEP]summer?[SEP]I love it, and I’ve never been there with any one but you.[SEP]Sometimes I go by myself, when I am particularly lonely.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Very well, the sole’s good there.[SEP]How many street pianos there are[SEP]about to-night![SEP]The fine weather must have thawed them out.[SEP]We’ve had[SEP]five miles of ‘Il Trovatore’ now.[SEP]They always make me feel jaunty.[SEP]Are[SEP]you comfy, and not too tired?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m not tired at all.[SEP]I was just wondering how people can ever die.[SEP]Why did you remind me of the mummy?[SEP]Life seems the strongest and most[SEP]indestructible thing in the world.[SEP]Do you really believe that all those[SEP]people rushing about down there, going to good dinners and clubs and[SEP]theatres, will be dead some day, and not care about anything?[SEP]I don’t[SEP]believe it, and I know I shan’t die, ever![SEP]You see, I feel too—too[SEP]powerful![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The carriage stopped.[SEP]Bartley sprang out and swung her quickly to the[SEP]pavement.[SEP]As he lifted her in his two hands he whispered: “You[SEP]are—powerful![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER VIII[EOT]
[SOT]The last rehearsal was over, a tedious dress rehearsal which had lasted[SEP]all day and exhausted the patience of every one who had to do with it.[SEP]When Hilda had dressed for the street and came out of her[SEP]dressing-room, she found Hugh MacConnell waiting for her in the[SEP]corridor.[EOT]
[SOT]“The fog’s thicker than ever, Hilda.[SEP]There have been a great many[SEP]accidents to-day.[SEP]It’s positively unsafe for you to be out alone.[SEP]Will[SEP]you let me take you home?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“How good of you, Mac.[SEP]If you are going with me, I think I’d rather[SEP]walk.[SEP]I’ve had no exercise to-day, and all this has made me nervous.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I shouldn’t wonder,” said MacConnell dryly.[SEP]Hilda pulled down her veil[SEP]and they stepped out into the thick brown wash that submerged St.[SEP]Martin’s Lane.[SEP]MacConnell took her hand and tucked it snugly under his[SEP]arm.[SEP]“I’m sorry I was such a savage.[SEP]I hope you didn’t think I made an[SEP]ass of myself.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Not a bit of it.[SEP]I don’t wonder you were peppery.[SEP]Those things are[SEP]awfully trying.[SEP]How do you think it’s going?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Magnificently.[SEP]That’s why I got so stirred up.[SEP]We are going to hear[SEP]from this, both of us.[SEP]And that reminds me; I’ve got news for you.[SEP]They[SEP]are going to begin repairs on the theatre about the middle of March,[SEP]and we are to run over to New York for six weeks.[SEP]Bennett told me[SEP]yesterday that it was decided.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda looked up delightedly at the tall gray figure beside her.[SEP]He was[SEP]the only thing she could see, for they were moving through a dense[SEP]opaqueness, as if they were walking at the bottom of the ocean.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, Mac, how glad I am![SEP]And they love your things over there, don’t[SEP]they?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Shall you be glad for—any other reason, Hilda?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]MacConnell put his hand in front of her to ward off some dark object.[SEP]It proved to be only a lamp-post, and they beat in farther from the[SEP]edge of the pavement.[EOT]
[SOT]“What do you mean, Mac?[SEP]” Hilda asked nervously.[EOT]
[SOT]“I was just thinking there might be people over there you’d be glad to[SEP]see,” he brought out awkwardly.[SEP]Hilda said nothing, and as they walked[SEP]on MacConnell spoke again, apologetically: “I hope you don’t mind my[SEP]knowing about it, Hilda.[SEP]Don’t stiffen up like that.[SEP]No one else knows,[SEP]and I didn’t try to find out anything.[SEP]I felt it, even before I knew[SEP]who he was.[SEP]I knew there was somebody, and that it wasn’t I.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]They crossed Oxford Street in silence, feeling their way.[SEP]The busses[SEP]had stopped running and the cab-drivers were leading their horses.[SEP]When[SEP]they reached the other side, MacConnell said suddenly, “I hope you are[SEP]happy.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Terribly, dangerously happy, Mac,”—Hilda spoke quietly, pressing the[SEP]rough sleeve of his greatcoat with her gloved hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“You’ve always thought me too old for you, Hilda,—oh, of course you’ve[SEP]never said just that,—and here this fellow is not more than eight years[SEP]younger than I.[SEP]I’ve always felt that if I could get out of my old case[SEP]I might win you yet.[SEP]It’s a fine, brave youth I carry inside me, only[SEP]he’ll never be seen.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Nonsense, Mac.[SEP]That has nothing to do with it.[SEP]It’s because you seem[SEP]too close to me, too much my own kind.[SEP]It would be like marrying Cousin[SEP]Mike, almost.[SEP]I really tried to care as you wanted me to, away back in[SEP]the beginning.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, here we are, turning out of the Square.[SEP]You are not angry with[SEP]me, Hilda?[SEP]Thank you for this walk, my dear.[SEP]Go in and get dry things[SEP]on at once.[SEP]You’ll be having a great night to-morrow.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She put out her hand.[SEP]“Thank you, Mac, for everything.[SEP]Good-night.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]MacConnell trudged off through the fog, and she went slowly upstairs.[SEP]Her slippers and dressing gown were waiting for her before the fire.[SEP]“I[SEP]shall certainly see him in New York.[SEP]He will see by the papers that we[SEP]are coming.[SEP]Perhaps he knows it already,” Hilda kept thinking as she[SEP]undressed.[SEP]“Perhaps he will be at the dock.[SEP]No, scarcely that; but I[SEP]may meet him in the street even before he comes to see me.[SEP]” Marie[SEP]placed the tea-table by the fire and brought Hilda her letters.[SEP]She[SEP]looked them over, and started as she came to one in a handwriting that[SEP]she did not often see; Alexander had written to her only twice before,[SEP]and he did not allow her to write to him at all.[SEP]“Thank you, Marie.[SEP]You[SEP]may go now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda sat down by the table with the letter in her hand, still[SEP]unopened.[SEP]She looked at it intently, turned it over, and felt its[SEP]thickness with her fingers.[SEP]She believed that she sometimes had a kind[SEP]of second-sight about letters, and could tell before she read them[SEP]whether they brought good or evil tidings.[SEP]She put this one down on the[SEP]table in front of her while she poured her tea.[SEP]At last, with a little[SEP]shiver of expectancy, she tore open the envelope and read:—[EOT]
[SOT]BOSTON, February —[EOT]
[SOT]MY DEAR HILDA:—[EOT]
[SOT]It is after twelve o’clock.[SEP]Every one else is in bed and I am sitting[SEP]alone in my study.[SEP]I have been happier in this room than anywhere else[SEP]in the world.[SEP]Happiness like that makes one insolent.[SEP]I used to think[SEP]these four walls could stand against anything.[SEP]And now I scarcely know[SEP]myself here.[SEP]Now I know that no one can build his security upon the[SEP]nobleness of another person.[SEP]Two people, when they love each other,[SEP]grow alike in their tastes and habits and pride, but their moral[SEP]natures (whatever we may mean by that canting expression) are never[SEP]welded.[SEP]The base one goes on being base, and the noble one noble, to[SEP]the end.[EOT]
[SOT]The last week has been a bad one; I have been realizing how things used[SEP]to be with me.[SEP]Sometimes I get used to being dead inside, but lately it[SEP]has been as if a window beside me had suddenly opened, and as if all[SEP]the smells of spring blew in to me.[SEP]There is a garden out there, with[SEP]stars overhead, where I used to walk at night when I had a single[SEP]purpose and a single heart.[SEP]I can remember how I used to feel there,[SEP]how beautiful everything about me was, and what life and power and[SEP]freedom I felt in myself.[SEP]When the window opens I know exactly how it[SEP]would feel to be out there.[SEP]But that garden is closed to me.[SEP]How is it,[SEP]I ask myself, that everything can be so different with me when nothing[SEP]here has changed?[SEP]I am in my own house, in my own study, in the midst[SEP]of all these quiet streets where my friends live.[SEP]They are all safe and[SEP]at peace with themselves.[SEP]But I am never at peace.[SEP]I feel always on the[SEP]edge of danger and change.[EOT]
[SOT]I keep remembering locoed horses I used to see on the range when I was[SEP]a boy.[SEP]They changed like that.[SEP]We used to catch them and put them up in[SEP]the corral, and they developed great cunning.[SEP]They would pretend to eat[SEP]their oats like the other horses, but we knew they were always scheming[SEP]to get back at the loco.[EOT]
[SOT]It seems that a man is meant to live only one life in this world.[SEP]When[SEP]he tries to live a second, he develops another nature.[SEP]I feel as if a[SEP]second man had been grafted into me.[SEP]At first he seemed only a[SEP]pleasure-loving simpleton, of whose company I was rather ashamed, and[SEP]whom I used to hide under my coat when I walked the Embankment, in[SEP]London.[SEP]But now he is strong and sullen, and he is fighting for his[SEP]life at the cost of mine.[SEP]That is his one activity: to grow strong.[SEP]No[SEP]creature ever wanted so much to live.[SEP]Eventually, I suppose, he will[SEP]absorb me altogether.[SEP]Believe me, you will hate me then.[EOT]
[SOT]And what have you to do, Hilda, with this ugly story?[SEP]Nothing at all.[SEP]The little boy drank of the prettiest brook in the forest and he became[SEP]a stag.[SEP]I write all this because I can never tell it to you, and[SEP]because it seems as if I could not keep silent any longer.[SEP]And because[SEP]I suffer, Hilda.[SEP]If any one I loved suffered like this, I’d want to[SEP]know it.[SEP]Help me, Hilda![EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER IX[EOT]
[SOT]On the last Saturday in April, the New York “Times” published an[SEP]account of the strike complications which were delaying Alexander’s New[SEP]Jersey bridge, and stated that the engineer himself was in town and at[SEP]his office on West Tenth Street.[EOT]
[SOT]On Sunday, the day after this notice appeared, Alexander worked all day[SEP]at his Tenth Street rooms.[SEP]His business often called him to New York,[SEP]and he had kept an apartment there for years, subletting it when he[SEP]went abroad for any length of time.[SEP]Besides his sleeping-room and bath,[SEP]there was a large room, formerly a painter’s studio, which he used as a[SEP]study and office.[SEP]It was furnished with the cast-off possessions of his[SEP]bachelor days and with odd things which he sheltered for friends of his[SEP]who followed itinerant and more or less artistic callings.[SEP]Over the[SEP]fireplace there was a large old-fashioned gilt mirror.[SEP]Alexander’s big[SEP]work-table stood in front of one of the three windows, and above the[SEP]couch hung the one picture in the room, a big canvas of charming color[SEP]and spirit, a study of the Luxembourg Gardens in early spring, painted[SEP]in his youth by a man who had since become a portrait-painter of[SEP]international renown.[SEP]He had done it for Alexander when they were[SEP]students together in Paris.[EOT]
[SOT]Sunday was a cold, raw day and a fine rain fell continuously.[SEP]When[SEP]Alexander came back from dinner he put more wood on his fire, made[SEP]himself comfortable, and settled down at his desk, where he began[SEP]checking over estimate sheets.[SEP]It was after nine o’clock and he was[SEP]lighting a second pipe, when he thought he heard a sound at his door.[SEP]He started and listened, holding the burning match in his hand; again[SEP]he heard the same sound, like a firm, light tap.[SEP]He rose and crossed[SEP]the room quickly.[SEP]When he threw open the door he recognized the figure[SEP]that shrank back into the bare, dimly lit hallway.[SEP]He stood for a[SEP]moment in awkward constraint, his pipe in his hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come in,” he said to Hilda at last, and closed the door behind her.[SEP]He[SEP]pointed to a chair by the fire and went back to his worktable.[SEP]“Won’t[SEP]you sit down?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He was standing behind the table, turning over a pile of blueprints[SEP]nervously.[SEP]The yellow light from the student’s lamp fell on his hands[SEP]and the purple sleeves of his velvet smoking-jacket, but his flushed[SEP]face and big, hard head were in the shadow.[SEP]There was something about[SEP]him that made Hilda wish herself at her hotel again, in the street[SEP]below, anywhere but where she was.[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course I know, Bartley,” she said at last, “that after this you[SEP]won’t owe me the least consideration.[SEP]But we sail on Tuesday.[SEP]I saw[SEP]that interview in the paper yesterday, telling where you were, and I[SEP]thought I had to see you.[SEP]That’s all.[SEP]Good-night; I’m going now.[SEP]” She[SEP]turned and her hand closed on the door-knob.[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander hurried toward her and took her gently by the arm.[SEP]“Sit down,[SEP]Hilda; you’re wet through.[SEP]Let me take off your coat—and your boots;[SEP]they’re oozing water.[SEP]” He knelt down and began to unlace her shoes,[SEP]while Hilda shrank into the chair.[SEP]“Here, put your feet on this stool.[SEP]You don’t mean to say you walked down—and without overshoes![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda hid her face in her hands.[SEP]“I was afraid to take a cab.[SEP]Can’t you[SEP]see, Bartley, that I’m terribly frightened?[SEP]I’ve been through this a[SEP]hundred times to-day.[SEP]Don’t be any more angry than you can help.[SEP]I was[SEP]all right until I knew you were in town.[SEP]If you’d sent me a note, or[SEP]telephoned me, or anything![SEP]But you won’t let me write to you, and I[SEP]had to see you after that letter, that terrible letter you wrote me[SEP]when you got home.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander faced her, resting his arm on the mantel behind him, and[SEP]began to brush the sleeve of his jacket.[SEP]“Is this the way you mean to[SEP]answer it, Hilda?[SEP]” he asked unsteadily.[EOT]
[SOT]She was afraid to look up at him.[SEP]“Didn’t—didn’t you mean even to say[SEP]goodby to me, Bartley?[SEP]Did you mean just to—quit me?[SEP]” she asked.[SEP]“I[SEP]came to tell you that I’m willing to do as you asked me.[SEP]But it’s no[SEP]use talking about that now.[SEP]Give me my things, please.[SEP]” She put her[SEP]hand out toward the fender.[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander sat down on the arm of her chair.[SEP]“Did you think I had[SEP]forgotten you were in town, Hilda?[SEP]Do you think I kept away by[SEP]accident?[SEP]Did you suppose I didn’t know you were sailing on Tuesday?[SEP]There is a letter for you there, in my desk drawer.[SEP]It was to have[SEP]reached you on the steamer.[SEP]I was all the morning writing it.[SEP]I told[SEP]myself that if I were really thinking of you, and not of myself, a[SEP]letter would be better than nothing.[SEP]Marks on paper mean something to[SEP]you.[SEP]” He paused.[SEP]“They never did to me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda smiled up at him beautifully and put her hand on his sleeve.[SEP]“Oh,[SEP]Bartley![SEP]Did you write to me?[SEP]Why didn’t you telephone me to let me[SEP]know that you had?[SEP]Then I wouldn’t have come.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander slipped his arm about her.[SEP]“I didn’t know it before, Hilda,[SEP]on my honor I didn’t, but I believe it was because, deep down in me[SEP]somewhere, I was hoping I might drive you to do just this.[SEP]I’ve watched[SEP]that door all day.[SEP]I’ve jumped up if the fire crackled.[SEP]I think I have[SEP]felt that you were coming.[SEP]” He bent his face over her hair.[EOT]
[SOT]“And I,” she whispered,—“I felt that you were feeling that.[SEP]But when I[SEP]came, I thought I had been mistaken.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander started up and began to walk up and down the room.[EOT]
[SOT]“No, you weren’t mistaken.[SEP]I’ve been up in Canada with my bridge, and I[SEP]arranged not to come to New York until after you had gone.[SEP]Then, when[SEP]your manager added two more weeks, I was already committed.[SEP]” He dropped[SEP]upon the stool in front of her and sat with his hands hanging between[SEP]his knees.[SEP]“What am I to do, Hilda?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s what I wanted to see you about, Bartley.[SEP]I’m going to do what[SEP]you asked me to do when you were in London.[SEP]Only I’ll do it more[SEP]completely.[SEP]I’m going to marry.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, it doesn’t matter much![SEP]One of them.[SEP]Only not Mac.[SEP]I’m too fond of[SEP]him.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander moved restlessly.[SEP]“Are you joking, Hilda?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Indeed I’m not.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Then you don’t know what you’re talking about.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, I know very well.[SEP]I’ve thought about it a great deal, and I’ve[SEP]quite decided.[SEP]I never used to understand how women did things like[SEP]that, but I know now.[SEP]It’s because they can’t be at the mercy of the[SEP]man they love any longer.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander flushed angrily.[SEP]“So it’s better to be at the mercy of a man[SEP]you don’t love?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Under such circumstances, infinitely![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]There was a flash in her eyes that made Alexander’s fall.[SEP]He got up and[SEP]went over to the window, threw it open, and leaned out.[SEP]He heard Hilda[SEP]moving about behind him.[SEP]When he looked over his shoulder she was[SEP]lacing her boots.[SEP]He went back and stood over her.[EOT]
[SOT]“Hilda you’d better think a while longer before you do that.[SEP]I don’t[SEP]know what I ought to say, but I don’t believe you’d be happy; truly I[SEP]don’t.[SEP]Aren’t you trying to frighten me?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She tied the knot of the last lacing and put her boot-heel down firmly.[SEP]“No; I’m telling you what I’ve made up my mind to do.[SEP]I suppose I would[SEP]better do it without telling you.[SEP]But afterward I shan’t have an[SEP]opportunity to explain, for I shan’t be seeing you again.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander started to speak, but caught himself.[SEP]When Hilda rose he sat[SEP]down on the arm of her chair and drew her back into it.[EOT]
[SOT]“I wouldn’t be so much alarmed if I didn’t know how utterly reckless[SEP]you _can_ be.[SEP]Don’t do anything like that rashly.[SEP]” His face grew[SEP]troubled.[SEP]“You wouldn’t be happy.[SEP]You are not that kind of woman.[SEP]I’d[SEP]never have another hour’s peace if I helped to make you do a thing like[SEP]that.[SEP]” He took her face between his hands and looked down into it.[SEP]“You[SEP]see, you are different, Hilda.[SEP]Don’t you know you are?[SEP]” His voice grew[SEP]softer, his touch more and more tender.[SEP]“Some women can do that sort of[SEP]thing, but you—you can love as queens did, in the old time.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda had heard that soft, deep tone in his voice only once before.[SEP]She[SEP]closed her eyes; her lips and eyelids trembled.[SEP]“Only one, Bartley.[SEP]Only one.[SEP]And he threw it back at me a second time.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She felt the strength leap in the arms that held her so lightly.[EOT]
[SOT]“Try him again, Hilda.[SEP]Try him once again.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She looked up into his eyes, and hid her face in her hands.[EOT]
[SOT]On Tuesday afternoon a Boston lawyer, who had been trying a case in[SEP]Vermont, was standing on the siding at White River Junction when the[SEP]Canadian Express pulled by on its northward journey.[SEP]As the day-coaches[SEP]at the rear end of the long train swept by him, the lawyer noticed at[SEP]one of the windows a man’s head, with thick rumpled hair.[SEP]“Curious,” he[SEP]thought; “that looked like Alexander, but what would he be doing back[SEP]there in the daycoaches?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]It was, indeed, Alexander.[EOT]
[SOT]That morning a telegram from Moorlock had reached him, telling him that[SEP]there was serious trouble with the bridge and that he was needed there[SEP]at once, so he had caught the first train out of New York.[SEP]He had taken[SEP]a seat in a day-coach to avoid the risk of meeting any one he knew, and[SEP]because he did not wish to be comfortable.[SEP]When the telegram arrived,[SEP]Alexander was at his rooms on Tenth Street, packing his bag to go to[SEP]Boston.[SEP]On Monday night he had written a long letter to his wife, but[SEP]when morning came he was afraid to send it, and the letter was still in[SEP]his pocket.[SEP]Winifred was not a woman who could bear disappointment.[SEP]She[SEP]demanded a great deal of herself and of the people she loved; and she[SEP]never failed herself.[SEP]If he told her now, he knew, it would be[SEP]irretrievable.[SEP]There would be no going back.[SEP]He would lose the thing he[SEP]valued most in the world; he would be destroying himself and his own[SEP]happiness.[SEP]There would be nothing for him afterward.[SEP]He seemed to see[SEP]himself dragging out a restless existence on the Continent—Cannes,[SEP]Hyères, Algiers, Cairo—among smartly dressed, disabled men of every[SEP]nationality; forever going on journeys that led nowhere; hurrying to[SEP]catch trains that he might just as well miss; getting up in the morning[SEP]with a great bustle and splashing of water, to begin a day that had no[SEP]purpose and no meaning; dining late to shorten the night, sleeping late[SEP]to shorten the day.[EOT]
[SOT]And for what?[SEP]For a mere folly, a masquerade, a little thing that he[SEP]could not let go.[SEP]_And he could even let it go_, he told himself.[SEP]But[SEP]he had promised to be in London at mid-summer, and he knew that he[SEP]would go.[SEP].[SEP].[SEP].[SEP]It was impossible to live like this any longer.[EOT]
[SOT]And this, then, was to be the disaster that his old professor had[SEP]foreseen for him: the crack in the wall, the crash, the cloud of dust.[SEP]And he could not understand how it had come about.[SEP]He felt that he[SEP]himself was unchanged, that he was still there, the same man he had[SEP]been five years ago, and that he was sitting stupidly by and letting[SEP]some resolute offshoot of himself spoil his life for him.[SEP]This new[SEP]force was not he, it was but a part of him.[SEP]He would not even admit[SEP]that it was stronger than he; but it was more active.[SEP]It was by its[SEP]energy that this new feeling got the better of him.[SEP]His wife was the[SEP]woman who had made his life, gratified his pride, given direction to[SEP]his tastes and habits.[SEP]The life they led together seemed to him[SEP]beautiful.[SEP]Winifred still was, as she had always been, Romance for him,[SEP]and whenever he was deeply stirred he turned to her.[SEP]When the grandeur[SEP]and beauty of the world challenged him—as it challenges even the most[SEP]self-absorbed people—he always answered with her name.[SEP]That was his[SEP]reply to the question put by the mountains and the stars; to all the[SEP]spiritual aspects of life.[SEP]In his feeling for his wife there was all[SEP]the tenderness, all the pride, all the devotion of which he was[SEP]capable.[SEP]There was everything but energy; the energy of youth which[SEP]must register itself and cut its name before it passes.[SEP]This new[SEP]feeling was so fresh, so unsatisfied and light of foot.[SEP]It ran and was[SEP]not wearied, anticipated him everywhere.[SEP]It put a girdle round the[SEP]earth while he was going from New York to Moorlock.[SEP]At this moment, it[SEP]was tingling through him, exultant, and live as quicksilver,[SEP]whispering, “In July you will be in England.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Already he dreaded the long, empty days at sea, the monotonous Irish[SEP]coast, the sluggish passage up the Mersey, the flash of the boat train[SEP]through the summer country.[SEP]He closed his eyes and gave himself up to[SEP]the feeling of rapid motion and to swift, terrifying thoughts.[SEP]He was[SEP]sitting so, his face shaded by his hand, when the Boston lawyer saw him[SEP]from the siding at White River Junction.[EOT]
[SOT]When at last Alexander roused himself, the afternoon had waned to[SEP]sunset.[SEP]The train was passing through a gray country and the sky[SEP]overhead was flushed with a wide flood of clear color.[SEP]There was a[SEP]rose-colored light over the gray rocks and hills and meadows.[SEP]Off to[SEP]the left, under the approach of a weather-stained wooden bridge, a[SEP]group of boys were sitting around a little fire.[SEP]The smell of the wood[SEP]smoke blew in at the window.[SEP]Except for an old farmer, jogging along[SEP]the highroad in his box-wagon, there was not another living creature to[SEP]be seen.[SEP]Alexander looked back wistfully at the boys, camped on the[SEP]edge of a little marsh, crouching under their shelter and looking[SEP]gravely at their fire.[SEP]They took his mind back a long way, to a[SEP]campfire on a sandbar in a Western river, and he wished he could go[SEP]back and sit down with them.[SEP]He could remember exactly how the world[SEP]had looked then.[EOT]
[SOT]It was quite dark and Alexander was still thinking of the boys, when it[SEP]occurred to him that the train must be nearing Allway.[SEP]In going to his[SEP]new bridge at Moorlock he had always to pass through Allway.[SEP]The train[SEP]stopped at Allway Mills, then wound two miles up the river, and then[SEP]the hollow sound under his feet told Bartley that he was on his first[SEP]bridge again.[SEP]The bridge seemed longer than it had ever seemed before,[SEP]and he was glad when he felt the beat of the wheels on the solid[SEP]roadbed again.[SEP]He did not like coming and going across that bridge, or[SEP]remembering the man who built it.[SEP]And was he, indeed, the same man who[SEP]used to walk that bridge at night, promising such things to himself and[SEP]to the stars?[SEP]And yet, he could remember it all so well: the quiet[SEP]hills sleeping in the moonlight, the slender skeleton of the bridge[SEP]reaching out into the river, and up yonder, alone on the hill, the big[SEP]white house; upstairs, in Winifred’s window, the light that told him[SEP]she was still awake and still thinking of him.[SEP]And after the light went[SEP]out he walked alone, taking the heavens into his confidence, unable to[SEP]tear himself away from the white magic of the night, unwilling to sleep[SEP]because longing was so sweet to him, and because, for the first time[SEP]since first the hills were hung with moonlight, there was a lover in[SEP]the world.[SEP]And always there was the sound of the rushing water[SEP]underneath, the sound which, more than anything else, meant death; the[SEP]wearing away of things under the impact of physical forces which men[SEP]could direct but never circumvent or diminish.[SEP]Then, in the exaltation[SEP]of love, more than ever it seemed to him to mean death, the only other[SEP]thing as strong as love.[SEP]Under the moon, under the cold, splendid[SEP]stars, there were only those two things awake and sleepless; death and[SEP]love, the rushing river and his burning heart.[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander sat up and looked about him.[SEP]The train was tearing on through[SEP]the darkness.[SEP]All his companions in the day-coach were either dozing or[SEP]sleeping heavily, and the murky lamps were turned low.[SEP]How came he here[SEP]among all these dirty people?[SEP]Why was he going to London?[SEP]What did it[SEP]mean—what was the answer?[SEP]How could this happen to a man who had lived[SEP]through that magical spring and summer, and who had felt that the stars[SEP]themselves were but flaming particles in the far-away infinitudes of[SEP]his love?[EOT]
[SOT]What had he done to lose it?[SEP]How could he endure the baseness of life[SEP]without it?[SEP]And with every revolution of the wheels beneath him, the[SEP]unquiet quicksilver in his breast told him that at midsummer he would[SEP]be in London.[SEP]He remembered his last night there: the red foggy[SEP]darkness, the hungry crowds before the theatres, the hand-organs, the[SEP]feverish rhythm of the blurred, crowded streets, and the feeling of[SEP]letting himself go with the crowd.[SEP]He shuddered and looked about him at[SEP]the poor unconscious companions of his journey, unkempt and[SEP]travel-stained, now doubled in unlovely attitudes, who had come to[SEP]stand to him for the ugliness he had brought into the world.[EOT]
[SOT]And those boys back there, beginning it all just as he had begun it; he[SEP]wished he could promise them better luck.[SEP]Ah, if one could promise any[SEP]one better luck, if one could assure a single human being of happiness![SEP]He had thought he could do so, once; and it was thinking of that that[SEP]he at last fell asleep.[SEP]In his sleep, as if it had nothing fresher to[SEP]work upon, his mind went back and tortured itself with something years[SEP]and years away, an old, long-forgotten sorrow of his childhood.[EOT]
[SOT]When Alexander awoke in the morning, the sun was just rising through[SEP]pale golden ripples of cloud, and the fresh yellow light was vibrating[SEP]through the pine woods.[SEP]The white birches, with their little unfolding[SEP]leaves, gleamed in the lowlands, and the marsh meadows were already[SEP]coming to life with their first green, a thin, bright color which had[SEP]run over them like fire.[SEP]As the train rushed along the trestles,[SEP]thousands of wild birds rose screaming into the light.[SEP]The sky was[SEP]already a pale blue and of the clearness of crystal.[SEP]Bartley caught up[SEP]his bag and hurried through the Pullman coaches until he found the[SEP]conductor.[SEP]There was a stateroom unoccupied, and he took it and set[SEP]about changing his clothes.[SEP]Last night he would not have believed that[SEP]anything could be so pleasant as the cold water he dashed over his head[SEP]and shoulders and the freshness of clean linen on his body.[EOT]
[SOT]After he had dressed, Alexander sat down at the window and drew into[SEP]his lungs deep breaths of the pine-scented air.[SEP]He had awakened with[SEP]all his old sense of power.[SEP]He could not believe that things were as[SEP]bad with him as they had seemed last night, that there was no way to[SEP]set them entirely right.[SEP]Even if he went to London at midsummer, what[SEP]would that mean except that he was a fool?[SEP]And he had been a fool[SEP]before.[SEP]That was not the reality of his life.[SEP]Yet he knew that he would[SEP]go to London.[EOT]
[SOT]Half an hour later the train stopped at Moorlock.[SEP]Alexander sprang to[SEP]the platform and hurried up the siding, waving to Philip Horton, one of[SEP]his assistants, who was anxiously looking up at the windows of the[SEP]coaches.[SEP]Bartley took his arm and they went together into the station[SEP]buffet.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ll have my coffee first, Philip.[SEP]Have you had yours?[SEP]And now, what[SEP]seems to be the matter up here?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The young man, in a hurried, nervous way, began his explanation.[EOT]
[SOT]But Alexander cut him short.[SEP]“When did you stop work?[SEP]” he asked[SEP]sharply.[EOT]
[SOT]The young engineer looked confused.[SEP]“I haven’t stopped work yet, Mr.[SEP]Alexander.[SEP]I didn’t feel that I could go so far without definite[SEP]authorization from you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Then why didn’t you say in your telegram exactly what you thought, and[SEP]ask for your authorization?[SEP]You’d have got it quick enough.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, really, Mr. Alexander, I couldn’t be absolutely sure, you know,[SEP]and I didn’t like to take the responsibility of making it public.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander pushed back his chair and rose.[SEP]“Anything I do can be made[SEP]public, Phil.[SEP]You say that you believe the lower chords are showing[SEP]strain, and that even the workmen have been talking about it, and yet[SEP]you’ve gone on adding weight.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m sorry, Mr. Alexander, but I had counted on your getting here[SEP]yesterday.[SEP]My first telegram missed you somehow.[SEP]I sent one Sunday[SEP]evening, to the same address, but it was returned to me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Have you a carriage out there?[SEP]I must stop to send a wire.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander went up to the telegraph-desk and penciled the following[SEP]message to his wife:—[EOT]
[SOT]I may have to be here for some time.[SEP]Can you come up at once?[SEP]Urgent.[EOT]
[SOT]The Moorlock Bridge lay three miles above the town.[SEP]When they were[SEP]seated in the carriage, Alexander began to question his assistant[SEP]further.[SEP]If it were true that the compression members showed strain,[SEP]with the bridge only two thirds done, then there was nothing to do but[SEP]pull the whole structure down and begin over again.[SEP]Horton kept[SEP]repeating that he was sure there could be nothing wrong with the[SEP]estimates.[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander grew impatient.[SEP]“That’s all true, Phil, but we never were[SEP]justified in assuming that a scale that was perfectly safe for an[SEP]ordinary bridge would work with anything of such length.[SEP]It’s all very[SEP]well on paper, but it remains to be seen whether it can be done in[SEP]practice.[SEP]I should have thrown up the job when they crowded me.[SEP]It’s[SEP]all nonsense to try to do what other engineers are doing when you know[SEP]they’re not sound.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But just now, when there is such competition,” the younger man[SEP]demurred.[SEP]“And certainly that’s the new line of development.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander shrugged his shoulders and made no reply.[EOT]
[SOT]When they reached the bridge works, Alexander began his examination[SEP]immediately.[SEP]An hour later he sent for the superintendent.[SEP]“I think you[SEP]had better stop work out there at once, Dan.[SEP]I should say that the[SEP]lower chord here might buckle at any moment.[SEP]I told the Commission that[SEP]we were using higher unit stresses than any practice has established,[SEP]and we’ve put the dead load at a low estimate.[SEP]Theoretically it worked[SEP]out well enough, but it had never actually been tried.[SEP]” Alexander put[SEP]on his overcoat and took the superintendent by the arm.[SEP]“Don’t look so[SEP]chopfallen, Dan.[SEP]It’s a jolt, but we’ve got to face it.[SEP]It isn’t the[SEP]end of the world, you know.[SEP]Now we’ll go out and call the men off[SEP]quietly.[SEP]They’re already nervous, Horton tells me, and there’s no use[SEP]alarming them.[SEP]I’ll go with you, and we’ll send the end riveters in[SEP]first.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Alexander and the superintendent picked their way out slowly over the[SEP]long span.[SEP]They went deliberately, stopping to see what each gang was[SEP]doing, as if they were on an ordinary round of inspection.[SEP]When they[SEP]reached the end of the river span, Alexander nodded to the[SEP]superintendent, who quietly gave an order to the foreman.[SEP]The men in[SEP]the end gang picked up their tools and, glancing curiously at each[SEP]other, started back across the bridge toward the river-bank.[SEP]Alexander[SEP]himself remained standing where they had been working, looking about[SEP]him.[SEP]It was hard to believe, as he looked back over it, that the whole[SEP]great span was incurably disabled, was already as good as condemned,[SEP]because something was out of line in the lower chord of the cantilever[SEP]arm.[EOT]
[SOT]The end riveters had reached the bank and were dispersing among the[SEP]tool-houses, and the second gang had picked up their tools and were[SEP]starting toward the shore.[SEP]Alexander, still standing at the end of the[SEP]river span, saw the lower chord of the cantilever arm give a little,[SEP]like an elbow bending.[SEP]He shouted and ran after the second gang, but by[SEP]this time every one knew that the big river span was slowly settling.[SEP]There was a burst of shouting that was immediately drowned by the[SEP]scream and cracking of tearing iron, as all the tension work began to[SEP]pull asunder.[SEP]Once the chords began to buckle, there were thousands of[SEP]tons of ironwork, all riveted together and lying in midair without[SEP]support.[SEP]It tore itself to pieces with roaring and grinding and noises[SEP]that were like the shrieks of a steam whistle.[SEP]There was no shock of[SEP]any kind; the bridge had no impetus except from its own weight.[SEP]It[SEP]lurched neither to right nor left, but sank almost in a vertical line,[SEP]snapping and breaking and tearing as it went, because no integral part[SEP]could bear for an instant the enormous strain loosed upon it.[SEP]Some of[SEP]the men jumped and some ran, trying to make the shore.[EOT]
[SOT]At the first shriek of the tearing iron, Alexander jumped from the[SEP]downstream side of the bridge.[SEP]He struck the water without injury and[SEP]disappeared.[SEP]He was under the river a long time and had great[SEP]difficulty in holding his breath.[SEP]When it seemed impossible, and his[SEP]chest was about to heave, he thought he heard his wife telling him that[SEP]he could hold out a little longer.[SEP]An instant later his face cleared[SEP]the water.[SEP]For a moment, in the depths of the river, he had realized[SEP]what it would mean to die a hypocrite, and to lie dead under the last[SEP]abandonment of her tenderness.[SEP]But once in the light and air, he knew[SEP]he should live to tell her and to recover all he had lost.[SEP]Now, at[SEP]last, he felt sure of himself.[SEP]He was not startled.[SEP]It seemed to him[SEP]that he had been through something of this sort before.[SEP]There was[SEP]nothing horrible about it.[SEP]This, too, was life, and life was activity,[SEP]just as it was in Boston or in London.[SEP]He was himself, and there was[SEP]something to be done; everything seemed perfectly natural.[SEP]Alexander[SEP]was a strong swimmer, but he had gone scarcely a dozen strokes when the[SEP]bridge itself, which had been settling faster and faster, crashed into[SEP]the water behind him.[SEP]Immediately the river was full of drowning men.[SEP]A[SEP]gang of French Canadians fell almost on top of him.[SEP]He thought he had[SEP]cleared them, when they began coming up all around him, clutching at[SEP]him and at each other.[SEP]Some of them could swim, but they were either[SEP]hurt or crazed with fright.[SEP]Alexander tried to beat them off, but there[SEP]were too many of them.[SEP]One caught him about the neck, another gripped[SEP]him about the middle, and they went down together.[SEP]When he sank, his[SEP]wife seemed to be there in the water beside him, telling him to keep[SEP]his head, that if he could hold out the men would drown and release[SEP]him.[SEP]There was something he wanted to tell his wife, but he could not[SEP]think clearly for the roaring in his ears.[SEP]Suddenly he remembered what[SEP]it was.[SEP]He caught his breath, and then she let him go.[EOT]
[SOT]The work of recovering the dead went on all day and all the following[SEP]night.[SEP]By the next morning forty-eight bodies had been taken out of the[SEP]river, but there were still twenty missing.[SEP]Many of the men had fallen[SEP]with the bridge and were held down under the debris.[SEP]Early on the[SEP]morning of the second day a closed carriage was driven slowly along the[SEP]river-bank and stopped a little below the works, where the river boiled[SEP]and churned about the great iron carcass which lay in a straight line[SEP]two thirds across it.[SEP]The carriage stood there hour after hour, and[SEP]word soon spread among the crowds on the shore that its occupant was[SEP]the wife of the Chief Engineer; his body had not yet been found.[SEP]The[SEP]widows of the lost workmen, moving up and down the bank with shawls[SEP]over their heads, some of them carrying babies, looked at the rusty[SEP]hired hack many times that morning.[SEP]They drew near it and walked about[SEP]it, but none of them ventured to peer within.[SEP]Even half-indifferent[SEP]sightseers dropped their voices as they told a newcomer: “You see that[SEP]carriage over there?[SEP]That’s Mrs.[SEP]Alexander.[SEP]They haven’t found him yet.[SEP]She got off the train this morning.[SEP]Horton met her.[SEP]She heard it in[SEP]Boston yesterday—heard the newsboys crying it in the street.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]At noon Philip Horton made his way through the crowd with a tray and a[SEP]tin coffee-pot from the camp kitchen.[SEP]When he reached the carriage he[SEP]found Mrs.[SEP]Alexander just as he had left her in the early morning,[SEP]leaning forward a little, with her hand on the lowered window, looking[SEP]at the river.[SEP]Hour after hour she had been watching the water, the[SEP]lonely, useless stone towers, and the convulsed mass of iron wreckage[SEP]over which the angry river continually spat up its yellow foam.[EOT]
[SOT]“Those poor women out there, do they blame him very much?[SEP]” she asked,[SEP]as she handed the coffee-cup back to Horton.[EOT]
[SOT]“Nobody blames him, Mrs.[SEP]Alexander.[SEP]If any one is to blame, I’m afraid[SEP]it’s I.[SEP]I should have stopped work before he came.[SEP]He said so as soon[SEP]as I met him.[SEP]I tried to get him here a day earlier, but my telegram[SEP]missed him, somehow.[SEP]He didn’t have time really to explain to me.[SEP]If[SEP]he’d got here Monday, he’d have had all the men off at once.[SEP]But, you[SEP]see, Mrs.[SEP]Alexander, such a thing never happened before.[SEP]According to[SEP]all human calculations, it simply couldn’t happen.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Horton leaned wearily against the front wheel of the cab.[SEP]He had not[SEP]had his clothes off for thirty hours, and the stimulus of violent[SEP]excitement was beginning to wear off.[EOT]
[SOT]“Don’t be afraid to tell me the worst, Mr. Horton.[SEP]Don’t leave me to[SEP]the dread of finding out things that people may be saying.[SEP]If he is[SEP]blamed, if he needs any one to speak for him,”—for the first time her[SEP]voice broke and a flush of life, tearful, painful, and confused, swept[SEP]over her rigid pallor,—“if he needs any one, tell me, show me what to[SEP]do.[SEP]” She began to sob, and Horton hurried away.[EOT]
[SOT]When he came back at four o’clock in the afternoon he was carrying his[SEP]hat in his hand, and Winifred knew as soon as she saw him that they had[SEP]found Bartley.[SEP]She opened the carriage door before he reached her and[SEP]stepped to the ground.[EOT]
[SOT]Horton put out his hand as if to hold her back and spoke pleadingly:[SEP]“Won’t you drive up to my house, Mrs.[SEP]Alexander?[SEP]They will take him up[SEP]there.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Take me to him now, please.[SEP]I shall not make any trouble.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The group of men down under the riverbank fell back when they saw a[SEP]woman coming, and one of them threw a tarpaulin over the stretcher.[SEP]They took off their hats and caps as Winifred approached, and although[SEP]she had pulled her veil down over her face they did not look up at her.[SEP]She was taller than Horton, and some of the men thought she was the[SEP]tallest woman they had ever seen.[SEP]“As tall as himself,” some one[SEP]whispered.[SEP]Horton motioned to the men, and six of them lifted the[SEP]stretcher and began to carry it up the embankment.[SEP]Winifred followed[SEP]them the half-mile to Horton’s house.[SEP]She walked quietly, without once[SEP]breaking or stumbling.[SEP]When the bearers put the stretcher down in[SEP]Horton’s spare bedroom, she thanked them and gave her hand to each in[SEP]turn.[SEP]The men went out of the house and through the yard with their[SEP]caps in their hands.[SEP]They were too much confused to say anything as[SEP]they went down the hill.[EOT]
[SOT]Horton himself was almost as deeply perplexed.[SEP]“Mamie,” he said to his[SEP]wife, when he came out of the spare room half an hour later, “will you[SEP]take Mrs.[SEP]Alexander the things she needs?[SEP]She is going to do everything[SEP]herself.[SEP]Just stay about where you can hear her and go in if she wants[SEP]you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Everything happened as Alexander had foreseen in that moment of[SEP]prescience under the river.[SEP]With her own hands she washed him clean of[SEP]every mark of disaster.[SEP]All night he was alone with her in the still[SEP]house, his great head lying deep in the pillow.[SEP]In the pocket of his[SEP]coat Winifred found the letter that he had written her the night before[SEP]he left New York, water-soaked and illegible, but because of its[SEP]length, she knew it had been meant for her.[EOT]
[SOT]For Alexander death was an easy creditor.[SEP]Fortune, which had smiled[SEP]upon him consistently all his life, did not desert him in the end.[SEP]His[SEP]harshest critics did not doubt that, had he lived, he would have[SEP]retrieved himself.[SEP]Even Lucius Wilson did not see in this accident the[SEP]disaster he had once foretold.[EOT]
[SOT]When a great man dies in his prime there is no surgeon who can say[SEP]whether he did well; whether or not the future was his, as it seemed to[SEP]be.[SEP]The mind that society had come to regard as a powerful and reliable[SEP]machine, dedicated to its service, may for a long time have been sick[SEP]within itself and bent upon its own destruction.[EOT]
[SOT]Professor Wilson had been living in London for six years and he was[SEP]just back from a visit to America.[SEP]One afternoon, soon after his[SEP]return, he put on his frock-coat and drove in a hansom to pay a call[SEP]upon Hilda Burgoyne, who still lived at her old number, off Bedford[SEP]Square.[SEP]He and Miss Burgoyne had been fast friends for a long time.[SEP]He[SEP]had first noticed her about the corridors of the British Museum, where[SEP]he read constantly.[SEP]Her being there so often had made him feel that he[SEP]would like to know her, and as she was not an inaccessible person, an[SEP]introduction was not difficult.[SEP]The preliminaries once over, they came[SEP]to depend a great deal upon each other, and Wilson, after his day’s[SEP]reading, often went round to Bedford Square for his tea.[SEP]They had much[SEP]more in common than their memories of a common friend.[SEP]Indeed, they[SEP]seldom spoke of him.[SEP]They saved that for the deep moments which do not[SEP]come often, and then their talk of him was mostly silence.[SEP]Wilson knew[SEP]that Hilda had loved him; more than this he had not tried to know.[EOT]
[SOT]It was late when Wilson reached Hilda’s apartment on this particular[SEP]December afternoon, and he found her alone.[SEP]She sent for fresh tea and[SEP]made him comfortable, as she had such a knack of making people[SEP]comfortable.[EOT]
[SOT]“How good you were to come back before Christmas![SEP]I quite dreaded the[SEP]Holidays without you.[SEP]You’ve helped me over a good many Christmases.[SEP]”[SEP]She smiled at him gayly.[EOT]
[SOT]“As if you needed me for that![SEP]But, at any rate, I needed _you_.[SEP]How[SEP]well you are looking, my dear, and how rested.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He peered up at her from his low chair, balancing the tips of his long[SEP]fingers together in a judicial manner which had grown on him with[SEP]years.[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda laughed as she carefully poured his cream.[SEP]“That means that I was[SEP]looking very seedy at the end of the season, doesn’t it?[SEP]Well, we must[SEP]show wear at last, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson took the cup gratefully.[SEP]“Ah, no need to remind a man of[SEP]seventy, who has just been home to find that he has survived all his[SEP]contemporaries.[SEP]I was most gently treated—as a sort of precious relic.[SEP]But, do you know, it made me feel awkward to be hanging about still.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Seventy?[SEP]Never mention it to me.[SEP]” Hilda looked appreciatively at the[SEP]Professor’s alert face, with so many kindly lines about the mouth and[SEP]so many quizzical ones about the eyes.[SEP]“You’ve got to hang about for[SEP]me, you know.[SEP]I can’t even let you go home again.[SEP]You must stay put,[SEP]now that I have you back.[SEP]You’re the realest thing I have.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson chuckled.[SEP]“Dear me, am I?[SEP]Out of so many conquests and the[SEP]spoils of conquered cities![SEP]You’ve really missed me?[SEP]Well, then, I[SEP]shall hang.[SEP]Even if you have at last to put ME in the mummy-room with[SEP]the others.[SEP]You’ll visit me often, won’t you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Every day in the calendar.[SEP]Here, your cigarettes are in this drawer,[SEP]where you left them.[SEP]” She struck a match and lit one for him.[SEP]“But you[SEP]did, after all, enjoy being at home again?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, yes.[SEP]I found the long railway journeys trying.[SEP]People live a[SEP]thousand miles apart.[SEP]But I did it thoroughly; I was all over the[SEP]place.[SEP]It was in Boston I lingered longest.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah, you saw Mrs.[SEP]Alexander?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Often.[SEP]I dined with her, and had tea there a dozen different times, I[SEP]should think.[SEP]Indeed, it was to see her that I lingered on and on.[SEP]I[SEP]found that I still loved to go to the house.[SEP]It always seemed as if[SEP]Bartley were there, somehow, and that at any moment one might hear his[SEP]heavy tramp on the stairs.[SEP]Do you know, I kept feeling that he must be[SEP]up in his study.[SEP]” The Professor looked reflectively into the grate.[SEP]“I[SEP]should really have liked to go up there.[SEP]That was where I had my last[SEP]long talk with him.[SEP]But Mrs.[SEP]Alexander never suggested it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson was a little startled by her tone, and he turned his head so[SEP]quickly that his cuff-link caught the string of his nose-glasses and[SEP]pulled them awry.[SEP]“Why?[SEP]Why, dear me, I don’t know.[SEP]She probably never[SEP]thought of it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda bit her lip.[SEP]“I don’t know what made me say that.[SEP]I didn’t mean[SEP]to interrupt.[SEP]Go on please, and tell me how it was.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, it was like that.[SEP]Almost as if he were there.[SEP]In a way, he[SEP]really is there.[SEP]She never lets him go.[SEP]It’s the most beautiful and[SEP]dignified sorrow I’ve ever known.[SEP]It’s so beautiful that it has its[SEP]compensations, I should think.[SEP]Its very completeness is a compensation.[SEP]It gives her a fixed star to steer by.[SEP]She doesn’t drift.[SEP]We sat there[SEP]evening after evening in the quiet of that magically haunted room, and[SEP]watched the sunset burn on the river, and felt him.[SEP]Felt him with a[SEP]difference, of course.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda leaned forward, her elbow on her knee, her chin on her hand.[SEP]“With a difference?[SEP]Because of her, you mean?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson’s brow wrinkled.[SEP]“Something like that, yes.[SEP]Of course, as time[SEP]goes on, to her he becomes more and more their simple personal[SEP]relation.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda studied the droop of the Professor’s head intently.[SEP]“You didn’t[SEP]altogether like that?[SEP]You felt it wasn’t wholly fair to him?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson shook himself and readjusted his glasses.[SEP]“Oh, fair enough.[SEP]More[SEP]than fair.[SEP]Of course, I always felt that my image of him was just a[SEP]little different from hers.[SEP]No relation is so complete that it can hold[SEP]absolutely all of a person.[SEP]And I liked him just as he was; his[SEP]deviations, too; the places where he didn’t square.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda considered vaguely.[SEP]“Has she grown much older?[SEP]” she asked at[SEP]last.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, and no.[SEP]In a tragic way she is even handsomer.[SEP]But colder.[SEP]Cold[SEP]for everything but him.[SEP]‘Forget thyself to marble’; I kept thinking of[SEP]that.[SEP]Her happiness was a happiness _à deux_, not apart from the world,[SEP]but actually against it.[SEP]And now her grief is like that.[SEP]She saves[SEP]herself for it and doesn’t even go through the form of seeing people[SEP]much.[SEP]I’m sorry.[SEP]It would be better for her, and might be so good for[SEP]them, if she could let other people in.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Perhaps she’s afraid of letting him out a little, of sharing him with[SEP]somebody.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson put down his cup and looked up with vague alarm.[SEP]“Dear me, it[SEP]takes a woman to think of that, now![SEP]I don’t, you know, think we ought[SEP]to be hard on her.[SEP]More, even, than the rest of us she didn’t choose[SEP]her destiny.[SEP]She underwent it.[SEP]And it has left her chilled.[SEP]As to her[SEP]not wishing to take the world into her confidence—well, it is a pretty[SEP]brutal and stupid world, after all, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hilda leaned forward.[SEP]“Yes, I know, I know.[SEP]Only I can’t help being[SEP]glad that there was something for him even in stupid and vulgar people.[SEP]My little Marie worshiped him.[SEP]When she is dusting I always know when[SEP]she has come to his picture.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Wilson nodded.[SEP]“Oh, yes![SEP]He left an echo.[SEP]The ripples go on in all of[SEP]us.[SEP]He belonged to the people who make the play, and most of us are[SEP]only onlookers at the best.[SEP]We shouldn’t wonder too much at Mrs.[SEP]Alexander.[SEP]She must feel how useless it would be to stir about, that[SEP]she may as well sit still; that nothing can happen to her after[SEP]Bartley.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes,” said Hilda softly, “nothing can happen to one after Bartley.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]They both sat looking into the fire.[EOT]
[SOT]THE BARREL ORGAN by Alfred Noyes[EOT]
[SOT]There’s a barrel-organ caroling across a golden street,[SEP]In the City as the sun sinks low;[SEP]And the music’s not immortal; but the world has made it sweet[SEP]And fulfilled it with the sunset glow;[SEP]And it pulses through the pleasures of the City and the pain[SEP]That surround the singing organ like a large eternal light;[SEP]And they’ve given it a glory and a part to play again[SEP]In the Symphony that rules the day and the night.[EOT]
[SOT]And now it’s marching onward through the realms of old romance,[SEP]And trolling out a fond familiar tune,[SEP]And now it’s roaring cannon down to fight the King of France,[SEP]And now it’s prattling softly to the moon,[SEP]And all around the organ there’s a sea without a shore[SEP]Of human joys and wonders and regrets;[SEP]To remember and to recompense the music evermore[SEP]For what the cold machinery forgets.[SEP].[SEP].[SEP].[EOT]
[SOT]Yes; as the music changes,[SEP]Like a prismatic glass,[SEP]It takes the light and ranges[SEP]Through all the moods that pass;[SEP]Dissects the common carnival[SEP]Of passions and regrets,[SEP]And gives the world a glimpse of all[SEP]The colors it forgets.[EOT]
[SOT]And there _La Traviata_ sights[SEP]Another sadder song;[SEP]And there _Il Trovatore_ cries[SEP]A tale of deeper wrong;[SEP]And bolder knights to battle go[SEP]With sword and shield and lance,[SEP]Than ever here on earth below[SEP]Have whirled into—_a dance![SEP]_—[EOT]
[SOT]Go down to Kew in lilac time; in lilac time; in lilac time;[SEP]Go down to Kew in lilac time; (it isn’t far from London![SEP])[SEP]And you shall wander hand in hand with love in summer’s wonderland;[SEP]Go down to Kew in lilac time; (it isn’t far from London![SEP])[EOT]
[SOT]The cherry-trees are seas of bloom and soft perfume and sweet perfume,[SEP]The cherry-trees are seas of bloom (and oh, so near to London![SEP])[SEP]And there they say, when dawn is high and all the world’s a blaze of[SEP]sky[SEP]The cuckoo, though he’s very shy, will sing a song for London.[EOT]
[SOT]The nightingale is rather rare and yet they say you’ll hear him there[SEP]At Kew, at Kew in lilac time (and oh, so near to London![SEP])[SEP]The linnet and the throstle, too, and after dark the long halloo[SEP]And golden-eyed _tu-whit, tu whoo_ of owls that ogle London.[EOT]
[SOT]For Noah hardly knew a bird of any kind that isn’t heard[SEP]At Kew, at Kew in lilac time (and oh, so near to London![SEP])[SEP]And when the rose begins to pout and all the chestnut spires are out[SEP]You’ll hear the rest without a doubt, all chorusing for London:—[EOT]
[SOT]_Come down to Kew in lilac time; in lilac time; in lilac time;[SEP]Come down to Kew in lilac time;_ (_it isn’t far from London![SEP]_)[SEP]_And you shall wander hand in hand with love in summer’s wonderland;[SEP]Come down to Kew in lilac time;_ (_it isn’t far from London![SEP]_)[EOT]
[SOT]And then the troubadour begins to thrill the golden street,[SEP]In the City as the sun sinks low;[SEP]And in all the gaudy busses there are scores of weary feet[SEP]Marking time, sweet time, with a dull mechanic beat,[SEP]And a thousand hearts are plunging to a love they’ll never meet,[SEP]Through the meadows of the sunset, through the poppies and the wheat,[SEP]In the land where the dead dreams go.[EOT]
[SOT]Verdi, Verdi, when you wrote _Il Trovatore_ did you dream[SEP]Of the City when the sun sinks low[SEP]Of the organ and the monkey and the many-colored stream[SEP]On the Piccadilly pavement, of the myriad eyes that seem[SEP]To be litten for a moment with a wild Italian gleam[SEP]As _A che la morte_ parodies the world’s eternal theme[SEP]And pulses with the sunset glow?[EOT]
[SOT]There’s a thief, perhaps, that listens with a face of frozen stone[SEP]In the City as the sun sinks low;[SEP]There’s a portly man of business with a balance of his own,[SEP]There’s a clerk and there’s a butcher of a soft reposeful tone,[SEP]And they’re all them returning to the heavens they have known:[SEP]They are crammed and jammed in busses and—they’re each of them alone[SEP]In the land where the dead dreams go.[EOT]
[SOT]There’s a very modish woman and her smile is very bland[SEP]In the City as the sun sinks low;[SEP]And her hansom jingles onward, but her little jeweled hand[SEP]Is clenched a little tighter and she cannot understand[SEP]What she wants or why she wanders to that undiscovered land,[SEP]For the parties there are not at all the sort of thing she planned,[SEP]In the land where the dead dreams go.[EOT]
[SOT]There’s an Oxford man that listens and his heart is crying out[SEP]In the City as the sun sinks low;[SEP]For the barge the eight, the Isis, and the coach’s whoop and shout,[SEP]For the minute gun, the counting and the long disheveled rout,[SEP]For the howl along the tow-path and a fate that’s still in doubt,[SEP]For a roughened oar to handle and a race to think about[SEP]In the land where the dead dreams go.[EOT]
[SOT]There’s a laborer that listen to the voices of the dead[SEP]In the City as the sun sinks low;[SEP]And his hand begins to tremble and his face is rather red[SEP]As he sees a loafer watching him and—there he turns his head[SEP]And stares into the sunset where his April love is fled,[SEP]For he hears her softly singing and his lonely soul is led[SEP]Through the land where the dead dreams go.[EOT]
[SOT]There’s and old and hardened demi-rep, it’s ringing in her ears,[SEP]In the City as the sun sinks low;[SEP]With the wild and empty sorrow of the love that blights and sears,[SEP]Oh, and if she hurries onward, then be sure, be sure she hears,[SEP]Hears and bears the bitter burden of the unforgotten years,[SEP]And her laugh’s a little harsher and her eyes are brimmed with tears[SEP]For the land where the dead dreams go.[EOT]
[SOT]There’s a barrel-organ caroling across a golden street,[SEP]In the City as the sun sinks low;[SEP]Though the music’s only Verdi there’s a world to make it sweet[SEP]Just as yonder yellow sunset where the earth and heaven meet[SEP]Mellows all the sooty City![SEP]Hark, a hundred thousand feet[SEP]Are marching on to glory through the poppies and the wheat[SEP]In the land where the dead dreams go.[EOT]
[SOT]So it’s Jeremiah, Jeremiah,[SEP]What have you to say[SEP]When you meet the garland girls[SEP]Tripping on their way?[EOT]
[SOT]All around my gala hat[SEP]I wear a wreath of roses[SEP](A long and lonely year it is[SEP]I’ve waited for the May![SEP])[EOT]
[SOT]If any one should ask you,[SEP]The reason why I wear it is,[SEP]My own love, my true love, is coming home to-day.[EOT]
[SOT]It’s buy a bunch of violets for the lady[SEP](_It’s lilac time in London; it’s lilac time in London![SEP]_)[SEP]Buy a bunch of violets for the lady;[SEP]While the sky burns blue above:[EOT]
[SOT]On the other side of the street you’ll find it shady[SEP](_It’s lilac time in London; it’s lilac time in London![SEP]_)[SEP]But buy a bunch of violets for the lady;[SEP]And tell her she’s your own true love.[EOT]
[SOT]There’s a barrel-organ caroling across a golden street,[SEP]In the City as the sun sinks glittering and slow;[SEP]And the music’s not immortal, but the world has made it sweet[SEP]And enriched it with the harmonies that make a song complete[SEP]In the deeper heavens of music where the night and morning meet,[SEP]As it dies into the sunset glow;[EOT]
[SOT]And it pulses through the pleasures of the City and the pain[SEP]That surround the singing organ like a large eternal light,[SEP]And they’ve given it a glory and a part of play again[SEP]In the Symphony that rules the day and night.[EOT]
[SOT]And there, as the music changes,[SEP]The song runs round again;[SEP]Once more it turns and ranges[SEP]Through all its joy and pain:[SEP]Dissects the common carnival[SEP]Of passions and regrets;[SEP]And the wheeling world remembers all[SEP]The wheeling song forgets.[EOT]
[SOT]Once more _La Traviata_ sighs[SEP]Another sadder song:[SEP]Once more _Il Trovatore_ cries[SEP]A tale of deeper wrong;[SEP]Once more the knights to battle go[SEP]With sword and shield and lance,[SEP]Till once, once more, the shattered foe[SEP]Has whirled into—_a dance![SEP]_—[EOT]
[SOT]_Come down to Kew in lilac time; in lilac time; in lilac time;[SEP]Come down to Kew in lilac time;_ (_it isn’t far from London![SEP]_)[SEP]_And you shall wander hand in hand with love in summer’s wonderland;[SEP]Come down to Kew in lilac time;_ (_it isn’t far from London![SEP]_)[EOT]

[SOT]The Rassendylls--With a Word on the Elphbergs[EOT]
[SOT]“I wonder when in the world you’re going to do anything, Rudolf?[SEP]” said[SEP]my brother’s wife.[EOT]
[SOT]“My dear Rose,” I answered, laying down my egg-spoon, “why in the world[SEP]should I do anything?[SEP]My position is a comfortable one.[SEP]I have an[SEP]income nearly sufficient for my wants (no one’s income is ever quite[SEP]sufficient, you know), I enjoy an enviable social position: I am[SEP]brother to Lord Burlesdon, and brother-in-law to that charming lady, his[SEP]countess.[SEP]Behold, it is enough![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You are nine-and-twenty,” she observed, “and you’ve done nothing but--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Knock about?[SEP]It is true.[SEP]Our family doesn’t need to do things.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]This remark of mine rather annoyed Rose, for everybody knows (and[SEP]therefore there can be no harm in referring to the fact) that, pretty[SEP]and accomplished as she herself is, her family is hardly of the same[SEP]standing as the Rassendylls.[SEP]Besides her attractions, she possessed a[SEP]large fortune, and my brother Robert was wise enough not to mind about[SEP]her ancestry.[SEP]Ancestry is, in fact, a matter concerning which the next[SEP]observation of Rose’s has some truth.[EOT]
[SOT]“Good families are generally worse than any others,” she said.[EOT]
[SOT]Upon this I stroked my hair: I knew quite well what she meant.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m so glad Robert’s is black![SEP]” she cried.[EOT]
[SOT]At this moment Robert (who rises at seven and works before breakfast)[SEP]came in.[SEP]He glanced at his wife: her cheek was slightly flushed; he[SEP]patted it caressingly.[EOT]
[SOT]“What’s the matter, my dear?[SEP]” he asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“She objects to my doing nothing and having red hair,” said I, in an[SEP]injured tone.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh![SEP]of course he can’t help his hair,” admitted Rose.[EOT]
[SOT]“It generally crops out once in a generation,” said my brother.[SEP]“So does[SEP]the nose.[SEP]Rudolf has got them both.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I wish they didn’t crop out,” said Rose, still flushed.[EOT]
[SOT]“I rather like them myself,” said I, and, rising, I bowed to the[SEP]portrait of Countess Amelia.[EOT]
[SOT]My brother’s wife uttered an exclamation of impatience.[EOT]
[SOT]“I wish you’d take that picture away, Robert,” said she.[EOT]
[SOT]“My dear![SEP]” he cried.[EOT]
[SOT]“Good heavens![SEP]” I added.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then it might be forgotten,” she continued.[EOT]
[SOT]“Hardly--with Rudolf about,” said Robert, shaking his head.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why should it be forgotten?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Rudolf![SEP]” exclaimed my brother’s wife, blushing very prettily.[EOT]
[SOT]I laughed, and went on with my egg.[SEP]At least I had shelved the question[SEP]of what (if anything) I ought to do.[SEP]And, by way of closing the[SEP]discussion--and also, I must admit, of exasperating my strict little[SEP]sister-in-law a trifle more--I observed:[EOT]
[SOT]“I rather like being an Elphberg myself.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]When I read a story, I skip the explanations; yet the moment I begin to[SEP]write one, I find that I must have an explanation.[SEP]For it is manifest[SEP]that I must explain why my sister-in-law was vexed with my nose and[SEP]hair, and why I ventured to call myself an Elphberg.[SEP]For eminent as,[SEP]I must protest, the Rassendylls have been for many generations, yet[SEP]participation in their blood of course does not, at first sight, justify[SEP]the boast of a connection with the grander stock of the Elphbergs or[SEP]a claim to be one of that Royal House.[SEP]For what relationship is there[SEP]between Ruritania and Burlesdon, between the Palace at Strelsau or the[SEP]Castle of Zenda and Number 305 Park Lane, W.[SEP]?[EOT]
[SOT]Well then--and I must premise that I am going, perforce, to rake up the[SEP]very scandal which my dear Lady Burlesdon wishes forgotten--in the year[SEP]1733, George II.[SEP]sitting then on the throne, peace reigning for[SEP]the moment, and the King and the Prince of Wales being not yet at[SEP]loggerheads, there came on a visit to the English Court a certain[SEP]prince, who was afterwards known to history as Rudolf the Third of[SEP]Ruritania.[SEP]The prince was a tall, handsome young fellow, marked (maybe[SEP]marred, it is not for me to say) by a somewhat unusually long, sharp and[SEP]straight nose, and a mass of dark-red hair--in fact, the nose and the[SEP]hair which have stamped the Elphbergs time out of mind.[SEP]He stayed some[SEP]months in England, where he was most courteously received; yet, in[SEP]the end, he left rather under a cloud.[SEP]For he fought a duel (it was[SEP]considered highly well bred of him to waive all question of his rank)[SEP]with a nobleman, well known in the society of the day, not only for his[SEP]own merits, but as the husband of a very beautiful wife.[SEP]In that duel[SEP]Prince Rudolf received a severe wound, and, recovering therefrom, was[SEP]adroitly smuggled off by the Ruritanian ambassador, who had found him[SEP]a pretty handful.[SEP]The nobleman was not wounded in the duel; but the[SEP]morning being raw and damp on the occasion of the meeting, he contracted[SEP]a severe chill, and, failing to throw it off, he died some six months[SEP]after the departure of Prince Rudolf, without having found leisure to[SEP]adjust his relations with his wife--who, after another two months, bore[SEP]an heir to the title and estates of the family of Burlesdon.[SEP]This lady[SEP]was the Countess Amelia, whose picture my sister-in-law wished to remove[SEP]from the drawing-room in Park Lane; and her husband was James, fifth[SEP]Earl of Burlesdon and twenty-second Baron Rassendyll, both in the[SEP]peerage of England, and a Knight of the Garter.[SEP]As for Rudolf, he went[SEP]back to Ruritania, married a wife, and ascended the throne, whereon his[SEP]progeny in the direct line have sat from then till this very hour--with[SEP]one short interval.[SEP]And, finally, if you walk through the picture[SEP]galleries at Burlesdon, among the fifty portraits or so of the last[SEP]century and a half, you will find five or six, including that of the[SEP]sixth earl, distinguished by long, sharp, straight noses and a quantity[SEP]of dark-red hair; these five or six have also blue eyes, whereas among[SEP]the Rassendylls dark eyes are the commoner.[EOT]
[SOT]That is the explanation, and I am glad to have finished it: the[SEP]blemishes on honourable lineage are a delicate subject, and certainly[SEP]this heredity we hear so much about is the finest scandalmonger in the[SEP]world; it laughs at discretion, and writes strange entries between the[SEP]lines of the “Peerages”.[EOT]
[SOT]It will be observed that my sister-in-law, with a want of logic that[SEP]must have been peculiar to herself (since we are no longer allowed to[SEP]lay it to the charge of her sex), treated my complexion almost as an[SEP]offence for which I was responsible, hastening to assume from that[SEP]external sign inward qualities of which I protest my entire innocence;[SEP]and this unjust inference she sought to buttress by pointing to the[SEP]uselessness of the life I had led.[SEP]Well, be that as it may, I had picked[SEP]up a good deal of pleasure and a good deal of knowledge.[SEP]I had been to[SEP]a German school and a German university, and spoke German as readily[SEP]and perfectly as English; I was thoroughly at home in French; I had a[SEP]smattering of Italian and enough Spanish to swear by.[SEP]I was, I believe,[SEP]a strong, though hardly fine swordsman and a good shot.[SEP]I could ride[SEP]anything that had a back to sit on; and my head was as cool a one as you[SEP]could find, for all its flaming cover.[SEP]If you say that I ought to have[SEP]spent my time in useful labour, I am out of Court and have nothing[SEP]to say, save that my parents had no business to leave me two thousand[SEP]pounds a year and a roving disposition.[EOT]
[SOT]“The difference between you and Robert,” said my sister-in-law, who[SEP]often (bless her![SEP]) speaks on a platform, and oftener still as if she[SEP]were on one, “is that he recognizes the duties of his position, and you[SEP]see the opportunities of yours.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“To a man of spirit, my dear Rose,” I answered, “opportunities are[SEP]duties.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Nonsense![SEP]” said she, tossing her head; and after a moment she went on:[SEP]“Now, here’s Sir Jacob Borrodaile offering you exactly what you might be[SEP]equal to.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“A thousand thanks![SEP]” I murmured.[EOT]
[SOT]“He’s to have an Embassy in six months, and Robert says he is sure that[SEP]he’ll take you as an attaché.[SEP]Do take it, Rudolf--to please me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Now, when my sister-in-law puts the matter in that way, wrinkling her[SEP]pretty brows, twisting her little hands, and growing wistful in the[SEP]eyes, all on account of an idle scamp like myself, for whom she has[SEP]no natural responsibility, I am visited with compunction.[SEP]Moreover, I[SEP]thought it possible that I could pass the time in the position suggested[SEP]with some tolerable amusement.[SEP]Therefore I said:[EOT]
[SOT]“My dear sister, if in six months’ time no unforeseen obstacle has[SEP]arisen, and Sir Jacob invites me, hang me if I don’t go with Sir Jacob![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, Rudolf, how good of you![SEP]I am glad![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Where’s he going to?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He doesn’t know yet; but it’s sure to be a good Embassy.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Madame,” said I, “for your sake I’ll go, if it’s no more than a[SEP]beggarly Legation.[SEP]When I do a thing, I don’t do it by halves.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]My promise, then, was given; but six months are six months, and seem an[SEP]eternity, and, inasmuch as they stretched between me and my prospective[SEP]industry (I suppose attachés are industrious; but I know not, for I[SEP]never became attaché to Sir Jacob or anybody else), I cast about for[SEP]some desirable mode of spending them.[SEP]And it occurred to me suddenly[SEP]that I would visit Ruritania.[SEP]It may seem strange that I had never[SEP]visited that country yet; but my father (in spite of a sneaking fondness[SEP]for the Elphbergs, which led him to give me, his second son, the famous[SEP]Elphberg name of Rudolf) had always been averse from my going, and,[SEP]since his death, my brother, prompted by Rose, had accepted the family[SEP]tradition which taught that a wide berth was to be given to that[SEP]country.[SEP]But the moment Ruritania had come into my head I was eaten up[SEP]with a curiosity to see it.[SEP]After all, red hair and long noses are[SEP]not confined to the House of Elphberg, and the old story seemed[SEP]a preposterously insufficient reason for debarring myself from[SEP]acquaintance with a highly interesting and important kingdom, one which[SEP]had played no small part in European history, and might do the like[SEP]again under the sway of a young and vigorous ruler, such as the new[SEP]King was rumoured to be.[SEP]My determination was clinched by reading in _The[SEP]Times_ that Rudolf the Fifth was to be crowned at Strelsau in the course[SEP]of the next three weeks, and that great magnificence was to mark[SEP]the occasion.[SEP]At once I made up my mind to be present, and began my[SEP]preparations.[SEP]But, inasmuch as it has never been my practice to furnish[SEP]my relatives with an itinerary of my journeys and in this case I[SEP]anticipated opposition to my wishes, I gave out that I was going for a[SEP]ramble in the Tyrol--an old haunt of mine--and propitiated Rose’s wrath[SEP]by declaring that I intended to study the political and social problems[SEP]of the interesting community which dwells in that neighbourhood.[EOT]
[SOT]“Perhaps,” I hinted darkly, “there may be an outcome of the expedition.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What do you mean?[SEP]” she asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well,” said I carelessly, “there seems a gap that might be filled by an[SEP]exhaustive work on--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh![SEP]will you write a book?[SEP]” she cried, clapping her hands.[SEP]“That would[SEP]be splendid, wouldn’t it, Robert?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s the best of introductions to political life nowadays,” observed my[SEP]brother, who has, by the way, introduced himself in this manner several[SEP]times over.[SEP]_Burlesdon on Ancient Theories and Modern Facts_ and _The[SEP]Ultimate Outcome, by a Political Student_, are both works of recognized[SEP]eminence.[EOT]
[SOT]“I believe you are right, Bob, my boy,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“Now promise you’ll do it,” said Rose earnestly.[EOT]
[SOT]“No, I won’t promise; but if I find enough material, I will.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s fair enough,” said Robert.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, material doesn’t matter![SEP]” she said, pouting.[EOT]
[SOT]But this time she could get no more than a qualified promise out of me.[SEP]To tell the truth, I would have wagered a handsome sum that the story[SEP]of my expedition that summer would stain no paper and spoil not a single[SEP]pen.[SEP]And that shows how little we know what the future holds; for here I[SEP]am, fulfilling my qualified promise, and writing, as I never thought[SEP]to write, a book--though it will hardly serve as an introduction to[SEP]political life, and has not a jot to do with the Tyrol.[EOT]
[SOT]Neither would it, I fear, please Lady Burlesdon, if I were to submit it[SEP]to her critical eye--a step which I have no intention of taking.[EOT]
[SOT]Concerning the Colour of Men’s Hair[EOT]
[SOT]It was a maxim of my Uncle William’s that no man should pass through[SEP]Paris without spending four-and-twenty hours there.[SEP]My uncle spoke out[SEP]of a ripe experience of the world, and I honoured his advice by putting[SEP]up for a day and a night at “The Continental” on my way to--the Tyrol.[SEP]I called on George Featherly at the Embassy, and we had a bit of dinner[SEP]together at Durand’s, and afterwards dropped in to the Opera; and[SEP]after that we had a little supper, and after that we called on Bertram[SEP]Bertrand, a versifier of some repute and Paris correspondent to _The[SEP]Critic_.[SEP]He had a very comfortable suite of rooms, and we found some[SEP]pleasant fellows smoking and talking.[SEP]It struck me, however, that[SEP]Bertram himself was absent and in low spirits, and when everybody except[SEP]ourselves had gone, I rallied him on his moping preoccupation.[SEP]He[SEP]fenced with me for a while, but at last, flinging himself on a sofa, he[SEP]exclaimed:[EOT]
[SOT]“Very well; have it your own way.[SEP]I am in love--infernally in love![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, you’ll write the better poetry,” said I, by way of consolation.[EOT]
[SOT]He ruffled his hair with his hand and smoked furiously.[SEP]George[SEP]Featherly, standing with his back to the mantelpiece, smiled unkindly.[EOT]
[SOT]“If it’s the old affair,” said he, “you may as well throw it up, Bert.[SEP]She’s leaving Paris tomorrow.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I know that,” snapped Bertram.[EOT]
[SOT]“Not that it would make any difference if she stayed,” pursued the[SEP]relentless George.[SEP]“She flies higher than the paper trade, my boy![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Hang her![SEP]” said Bertram.[EOT]
[SOT]“It would make it more interesting for me,” I ventured to observe, “if I[SEP]knew who you were talking about.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Antoinette Mauban,” said George.[EOT]
[SOT]“De Mauban,” growled Bertram.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oho![SEP]” said I, passing by the question of the `de’.[SEP]“You don’t mean to[SEP]say, Bert--?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Can’t you let me alone?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Where’s she going to?[SEP]” I asked, for the lady was something of a[SEP]celebrity.[EOT]
[SOT]George jingled his money, smiled cruelly at poor Bertram, and answered[SEP]pleasantly:[EOT]
[SOT]“Nobody knows.[SEP]By the way, Bert, I met a great man at her house the[SEP]other night--at least, about a month ago.[SEP]Did you ever meet him--the[SEP]Duke of Strelsau?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, I did,” growled Bertram.[EOT]
[SOT]“An extremely accomplished man, I thought him.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]It was not hard to see that George’s references to the duke were[SEP]intended to aggravate poor Bertram’s sufferings, so that I drew the[SEP]inference that the duke had distinguished Madame de Mauban by his[SEP]attentions.[SEP]She was a widow, rich, handsome, and, according to repute,[SEP]ambitious.[SEP]It was quite possible that she, as George put it, was flying[SEP]as high as a personage who was everything he could be, short of enjoying[SEP]strictly royal rank: for the duke was the son of the late King of[SEP]Ruritania by a second and morganatic marriage, and half-brother to the[SEP]new King.[SEP]He had been his father’s favourite, and it had occasioned[SEP]some unfavourable comment when he had been created a duke, with a title[SEP]derived from no less a city than the capital itself.[SEP]His mother had been[SEP]of good, but not exalted, birth.[EOT]
[SOT]“He’s not in Paris now, is he?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh no![SEP]He’s gone back to be present at the King’s coronation; a[SEP]ceremony which, I should say, he’ll not enjoy much.[SEP]But, Bert, old man,[SEP]don’t despair![SEP]He won’t marry the fair Antoinette--at least, not unless[SEP]another plan comes to nothing.[SEP]Still perhaps she--” He paused and added,[SEP]with a laugh: “Royal attentions are hard to resist--you know that, don’t[SEP]you, Rudolf?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Confound you![SEP]” said I; and rising, I left the hapless Bertram in[SEP]George’s hands and went home to bed.[EOT]
[SOT]The next day George Featherly went with me to the station, where I took[SEP]a ticket for Dresden.[EOT]
[SOT]“Going to see the pictures?[SEP]” asked George, with a grin.[EOT]
[SOT]George is an inveterate gossip, and had I told him that I was off to[SEP]Ruritania, the news would have been in London in three days and in Park[SEP]Lane in a week.[SEP]I was, therefore, about to return an evasive answer,[SEP]when he saved my conscience by leaving me suddenly and darting across[SEP]the platform.[SEP]Following him with my eyes, I saw him lift his hat and[SEP]accost a graceful, fashionably dressed woman who had just appeared from[SEP]the booking-office.[SEP]She was, perhaps, a year or two over thirty, tall,[SEP]dark, and of rather full figure.[SEP]As George talked, I saw her glance at[SEP]me, and my vanity was hurt by the thought that, muffled in a fur coat[SEP]and a neck-wrapper (for it was a chilly April day) and wearing a soft[SEP]travelling hat pulled down to my ears, I must be looking very far from[SEP]my best.[SEP]A moment later, George rejoined me.[EOT]
[SOT]“You’ve got a charming travelling companion,” he said.[SEP]“That’s poor Bert[SEP]Bertrand’s goddess, Antoinette de Mauban, and, like you, she’s going to[SEP]Dresden--also, no doubt, to see the pictures.[SEP]It’s very queer, though,[SEP]that she doesn’t at present desire the honour of your acquaintance.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I didn’t ask to be introduced,” I observed, a little annoyed.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, I offered to bring you to her; but she said, ‘Another time.[SEP]’[SEP]Never mind, old fellow, perhaps there’ll be a smash, and you’ll have a[SEP]chance of rescuing her and cutting out the Duke of Strelsau![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]No smash, however, happened, either to me or to Madame de Mauban.[SEP]I can[SEP]speak for her as confidently as for myself; for when, after a night’s[SEP]rest in Dresden, I continued my journey, she got into the same train.[SEP]Understanding that she wished to be let alone, I avoided her carefully,[SEP]but I saw that she went the same way as I did to the very end of my[SEP]journey, and I took opportunities of having a good look at her, when I[SEP]could do so unobserved.[EOT]
[SOT]As soon as we reached the Ruritanian frontier (where the old officer who[SEP]presided over the Custom House favoured me with such a stare that I felt[SEP]surer than before of my Elphberg physiognomy), I bought the papers, and[SEP]found in them news which affected my movements.[SEP]For some reason, which[SEP]was not clearly explained, and seemed to be something of a mystery, the[SEP]date of the coronation had been suddenly advanced, and the ceremony was[SEP]to take place on the next day but one.[SEP]The whole country seemed in a[SEP]stir about it, and it was evident that Strelsau was thronged.[SEP]Rooms were[SEP]all let and hotels overflowing; there would be very little chance of my[SEP]obtaining a lodging, and I should certainly have to pay an exorbitant[SEP]charge for it.[SEP]I made up my mind to stop at Zenda, a small town fifty[SEP]miles short of the capital, and about ten from the frontier.[SEP]My train[SEP]reached there in the evening; I would spend the next day, Tuesday, in a[SEP]wander over the hills, which were said to be very fine, and in taking[SEP]a glance at the famous Castle, and go over by train to Strelsau on the[SEP]Wednesday morning, returning at night to sleep at Zenda.[EOT]
[SOT]Accordingly at Zenda I got out, and as the train passed where I stood on[SEP]the platform, I saw my friend Madame de Mauban in her place; clearly she[SEP]was going through to Strelsau, having, with more providence than I could[SEP]boast, secured apartments there.[SEP]I smiled to think how surprised[SEP]George Featherly would have been to know that she and I had been fellow[SEP]travellers for so long.[EOT]
[SOT]I was very kindly received at the hotel--it was really no more than an[SEP]inn--kept by a fat old lady and her two daughters.[SEP]They were good,[SEP]quiet people, and seemed very little interested in the great doings at[SEP]Strelsau.[SEP]The old lady’s hero was the duke, for he was now, under the[SEP]late King’s will, master of the Zenda estates and of the Castle, which[SEP]rose grandly on its steep hill at the end of the valley a mile or so[SEP]from the inn.[SEP]The old lady, indeed, did not hesitate to express regret[SEP]that the duke was not on the throne, instead of his brother.[EOT]
[SOT]“We know Duke Michael,” said she.[SEP]“He has always lived among us; every[SEP]Ruritanian knows Duke Michael.[SEP]But the King is almost a stranger; he has[SEP]been so much abroad, not one in ten knows him even by sight.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And now,” chimed in one of the young women, “they say he has shaved off[SEP]his beard, so that no one at all knows him.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Shaved his beard![SEP]” exclaimed her mother.[SEP]“Who says so?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Johann, the duke’s keeper.[SEP]He has seen the King.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah, yes.[SEP]The King, sir, is now at the duke’s hunting-lodge in the[SEP]forest here; from here he goes to Strelsau to be crowned on Wednesday[SEP]morning.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I was interested to hear this, and made up my mind to walk next day in[SEP]the direction of the lodge, on the chance of coming across the King.[SEP]The[SEP]old lady ran on garrulously:[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah, and I wish he would stay at his hunting--that and wine (and one[SEP]thing more) are all he loves, they say--and suffer our duke to be[SEP]crowned on Wednesday.[SEP]That I wish, and I don’t care who knows it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Hush, mother![SEP]” urged the daughters.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, there’s many to think as I do![SEP]” cried the old woman stubbornly.[EOT]
[SOT]I threw myself back in my deep armchair, and laughed at her zeal.[EOT]
[SOT]“For my part,” said the younger and prettier of the two daughters, a[SEP]fair, buxom, smiling wench, “I hate Black Michael![SEP]A red Elphberg for[SEP]me, mother![SEP]The King, they say, is as red as a fox or as--”[EOT]
[SOT]And she laughed mischievously as she cast a glance at me, and tossed her[SEP]head at her sister’s reproving face.[EOT]
[SOT]“Many a man has cursed their red hair before now,” muttered the old[SEP]lady--and I remembered James, fifth Earl of Burlesdon.[EOT]
[SOT]“But never a woman![SEP]” cried the girl.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, and women, when it was too late,” was the stern answer, reducing[SEP]the girl to silence and blushes.[EOT]
[SOT]“How comes the King here?[SEP]” I asked, to break an embarrassed silence.[SEP]“It[SEP]is the duke’s land here, you say.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The duke invited him, sir, to rest here till Wednesday.[SEP]The duke is at[SEP]Strelsau, preparing the King’s reception.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Then they’re friends?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“None better,” said the old lady.[EOT]
[SOT]But my rosy damsel tossed her head again; she was not to be repressed[SEP]for long, and she broke out again:[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, they love one another as men do who want the same place and the[SEP]same wife![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The old woman glowered; but the last words pricked my curiosity, and I[SEP]interposed before she could begin scolding:[EOT]
[SOT]“What, the same wife, too![SEP]How’s that, young lady?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“All the world knows that Black Michael--well then, mother, the[SEP]duke--would give his soul to marry his cousin, the Princess Flavia, and[SEP]that she is to be the queen.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Upon my word,” said I, “I begin to be sorry for your duke.[SEP]But if a man[SEP]will be a younger son, why he must take what the elder leaves, and be[SEP]as thankful to God as he can;” and, thinking of myself, I shrugged my[SEP]shoulders and laughed.[SEP]And then I thought also of Antoinette de Mauban[SEP]and her journey to Strelsau.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s little dealing Black Michael has with--” began the girl, braving[SEP]her mother’s anger; but as she spoke a heavy step sounded on the floor,[SEP]and a gruff voice asked in a threatening tone:[EOT]
[SOT]“Who talks of ‘Black Michael’ in his Highness’s own burgh?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The girl gave a little shriek, half of fright--half, I think, of[SEP]amusement.[EOT]
[SOT]“You’ll not tell of me, Johann?[SEP]” she said.[EOT]
[SOT]“See where your chatter leads,” said the old lady.[EOT]
[SOT]The man who had spoken came forward.[EOT]
[SOT]“We have company, Johann,” said my hostess, and the fellow plucked off[SEP]his cap.[SEP]A moment later he saw me, and, to my amazement, he started back[SEP]a step, as though he had seen something wonderful.[EOT]
[SOT]“What ails you, Johann?[SEP]” asked the elder girl.[SEP]“This is a gentleman on[SEP]his travels, come to see the coronation.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The man had recovered himself, but he was staring at me with an intense,[SEP]searching, almost fierce glance.[EOT]
[SOT]“Good evening to you,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“Good evening, sir,” he muttered, still scrutinizing me, and the merry[SEP]girl began to laugh as she called--[EOT]
[SOT]“See, Johann, it is the colour you love![SEP]He started to see your hair,[SEP]sir.[SEP]It’s not the colour we see most of here in Zenda.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I crave your pardon, sir,” stammered the fellow, with puzzled eyes.[SEP]“I[SEP]expected to see no one.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Give him a glass to drink my health in; and I’ll bid you good night,[SEP]and thanks to you, ladies, for your courtesy and pleasant conversation.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]So speaking, I rose to my feet, and with a slight bow turned to the[SEP]door.[SEP]The young girl ran to light me on the way, and the man fell back[SEP]to let me pass, his eyes still fixed on me.[SEP]The moment I was by, he[SEP]started a step forward, asking:[EOT]
[SOT]“Pray, sir, do you know our King?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I never saw him,” said I.[SEP]“I hope to do so on Wednesday.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He said no more, but I felt his eyes following me till the door closed[SEP]behind me.[SEP]My saucy conductor, looking over her shoulder at me as she[SEP]preceded me upstairs, said:[EOT]
[SOT]“There’s no pleasing Master Johann for one of your colour, sir.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He prefers yours, maybe?[SEP]” I suggested.[EOT]
[SOT]“I meant, sir, in a man,” she answered, with a coquettish glance.[EOT]
[SOT]“What,” asked I, taking hold of the other side of the candlestick, “does[SEP]colour matter in a man?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Nay, but I love yours--it’s the Elphberg red.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Colour in a man,” said I, “is a matter of no more moment than[SEP]that![SEP]”--and I gave her something of no value.[EOT]
[SOT]“God send the kitchen door be shut![SEP]” said she.[EOT]
[SOT]“Amen![SEP]” said I, and left her.[EOT]
[SOT]In fact, however, as I now know, colour is sometimes of considerable[SEP]moment to a man.[EOT]
[SOT]A Merry Evening with a Distant Relative[EOT]
[SOT]I was not so unreasonable as to be prejudiced against the duke’s keeper[SEP]because he disliked my complexion; and if I had been, his most civil[SEP]and obliging conduct (as it seemed to me to be) next morning would have[SEP]disarmed me.[SEP]Hearing that I was bound for Strelsau, he came to see[SEP]me while I was breakfasting, and told me that a sister of his who had[SEP]married a well-to-do tradesman and lived in the capital, had invited[SEP]him to occupy a room in her house.[SEP]He had gladly accepted, but now found[SEP]that his duties would not permit of his absence.[SEP]He begged therefore[SEP]that, if such humble (though, as he added, clean and comfortable)[SEP]lodgings would satisfy me, I would take his place.[SEP]He pledged his[SEP]sister’s acquiescence, and urged the inconvenience and crowding to which[SEP]I should be subject in my journeys to and from Strelsau the next day.[SEP]I accepted his offer without a moment’s hesitation, and he went off to[SEP]telegraph to his sister, while I packed up and prepared to take the next[SEP]train.[SEP]But I still hankered after the forest and the hunting-lodge, and[SEP]when my little maid told me that I could, by walking ten miles or so[SEP]through the forest, hit the railway at a roadside station, I decided to[SEP]send my luggage direct to the address which Johann had given, take my[SEP]walk, and follow to Strelsau myself.[SEP]Johann had gone off and was not[SEP]aware of the change in my plans; but, as its only effect was to delay[SEP]my arrival at his sister’s for a few hours, there was no reason for[SEP]troubling to inform him of it.[SEP]Doubtless the good lady would waste no[SEP]anxiety on my account.[EOT]
[SOT]I took an early luncheon, and, having bidden my kind entertainers[SEP]farewell, promising to return to them on my way home, I set out to climb[SEP]the hill that led to the Castle, and thence to the forest of Zenda.[SEP]Half an hour’s leisurely walking brought me to the Castle.[SEP]It had been[SEP]a fortress in old days, and the ancient keep was still in good[SEP]preservation and very imposing.[SEP]Behind it stood another portion of the[SEP]original castle, and behind that again, and separated from it by a deep[SEP]and broad moat, which ran all round the old buildings, was a handsome[SEP]modern chateau, erected by the last king, and now forming the country[SEP]residence of the Duke of Strelsau.[SEP]The old and the new portions were[SEP]connected by a drawbridge, and this indirect mode of access formed the[SEP]only passage between the old building and the outer world; but leading[SEP]to the modern chateau there was a broad and handsome avenue.[SEP]It was an[SEP]ideal residence: when “Black Michael” desired company, he could dwell in[SEP]his chateau; if a fit of misanthropy seized him, he had merely to cross[SEP]the bridge and draw it up after him (it ran on rollers), and nothing[SEP]short of a regiment and a train of artillery could fetch him out.[SEP]I went[SEP]on my way, glad that poor Black Michael, though he could not have the[SEP]throne or the princess, had, at least, as fine a residence as any prince[SEP]in Europe.[EOT]
[SOT]Soon I entered the forest, and walked on for an hour or more in its cool[SEP]sombre shade.[SEP]The great trees enlaced with one another over my head, and[SEP]the sunshine stole through in patches as bright as diamonds, and[SEP]hardly bigger.[SEP]I was enchanted with the place, and, finding a felled[SEP]tree-trunk, propped my back against it, and stretching my legs out gave[SEP]myself up to undisturbed contemplation of the solemn beauty of the woods[SEP]and to the comfort of a good cigar.[SEP]And when the cigar was finished and[SEP]I had (I suppose) inhaled as much beauty as I could, I went off into[SEP]the most delightful sleep, regardless of my train to Strelsau and of[SEP]the fast-waning afternoon.[SEP]To remember a train in such a spot would[SEP]have been rank sacrilege.[SEP]Instead of that, I fell to dreaming that I[SEP]was married to the Princess Flavia and dwelt in the Castle of Zenda, and[SEP]beguiled whole days with my love in the glades of the forest--which made[SEP]a very pleasant dream.[SEP]In fact, I was just impressing a fervent kiss on[SEP]the charming lips of the princess, when I heard (and the voice seemed at[SEP]first a part of the dream) someone exclaim, in rough strident tones.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why, the devil’s in it![SEP]Shave him, and he’d be the King![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The idea seemed whimsical enough for a dream: by the sacrifice of my[SEP]heavy moustache and carefully pointed imperial, I was to be transformed[SEP]into a monarch![SEP]I was about to kiss the princess again, when I arrived[SEP](very reluctantly) at the conclusion that I was awake.[EOT]
[SOT]I opened my eyes, and found two men regarding me with much curiosity.[SEP]Both wore shooting costumes and carried guns.[SEP]One was rather short[SEP]and very stoutly built, with a big bullet-shaped head, a bristly grey[SEP]moustache, and small pale-blue eyes, a trifle bloodshot.[SEP]The other was a[SEP]slender young fellow, of middle height, dark in complexion, and bearing[SEP]himself with grace and distinction.[SEP]I set the one down as an old[SEP]soldier: the other for a gentleman accustomed to move in good society,[SEP]but not unused to military life either.[SEP]It turned out afterwards that my[SEP]guess was a good one.[EOT]
[SOT]The elder man approached me, beckoning the younger to follow.[SEP]He did so,[SEP]courteously raising his hat.[SEP]I rose slowly to my feet.[EOT]
[SOT]“He’s the height, too![SEP]” I heard the elder murmur, as he surveyed my six[SEP]feet two inches of stature.[SEP]Then, with a cavalier touch of the cap, he[SEP]addressed me:[EOT]
[SOT]“May I ask your name?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“As you have taken the first step in the acquaintance, gentlemen,” said[SEP]I, with a smile, “suppose you give me a lead in the matter of names.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The young man stepped forward with a pleasant smile.[EOT]
[SOT]“This,” said he, “is Colonel Sapt, and I am called Fritz von Tarlenheim:[SEP]we are both in the service of the King of Ruritania.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I bowed and, baring my head, answered:[EOT]
[SOT]“I am Rudolf Rassendyll.[SEP]I am a traveller from England; and once for a[SEP]year or two I held a commission from her Majesty the Queen.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Then we are all brethren of the sword,” answered Tarlenheim, holding[SEP]out his hand, which I took readily.[EOT]
[SOT]“Rassendyll, Rassendyll![SEP]” muttered Colonel Sapt; then a gleam of[SEP]intelligence flitted across his face.[EOT]
[SOT]“By Heaven![SEP]” he cried, “you’re of the Burlesdons?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“My brother is now Lord Burlesdon,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“Thy head betrayeth thee,” he chuckled, pointing to my uncovered poll.[SEP]“Why, Fritz, you know the story?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The young man glanced apologetically at me.[SEP]He felt a delicacy which[SEP]my sister-in-law would have admired.[SEP]To put him at his ease, I remarked[SEP]with a smile:[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah![SEP]the story is known here as well as among us, it seems.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Known![SEP]” cried Sapt.[SEP]“If you stay here, the deuce a man in all Ruritania[SEP]will doubt of it--or a woman either.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I began to feel uncomfortable.[SEP]Had I realized what a very plainly[SEP]written pedigree I carried about with me, I should have thought long[SEP]before I visited Ruritania.[SEP]However, I was in for it now.[EOT]
[SOT]At this moment a ringing voice sounded from the wood behind us:[EOT]
[SOT]“Fritz, Fritz![SEP]where are you, man?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Tarlenheim started, and said hastily:[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s the King![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Old Sapt chuckled again.[EOT]
[SOT]Then a young man jumped out from behind the trunk of a tree and stood[SEP]beside us.[SEP]As I looked at him, I uttered an astonished cry; and he,[SEP]seeing me, drew back in sudden wonder.[SEP]Saving the hair on my face and[SEP]a manner of conscious dignity which his position gave him, saving also[SEP]that he lacked perhaps half an inch--nay, less than that, but still[SEP]something--of my height, the King of Ruritania might have been Rudolf[SEP]Rassendyll, and I, Rudolf, the King.[EOT]
[SOT]For an instant we stood motionless, looking at one another.[SEP]Then I bared[SEP]my head again and bowed respectfully.[SEP]The King found his voice, and[SEP]asked in bewilderment:[EOT]
[SOT]“Colonel--Fritz--who is this gentleman?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I was about to answer, when Colonel Sapt stepped between the King and[SEP]me, and began to talk to his Majesty in a low growl.[SEP]The King towered[SEP]over Sapt, and, as he listened, his eyes now and again sought mine.[SEP]I looked at him long and carefully.[SEP]The likeness was certainly[SEP]astonishing, though I saw the points of difference also.[SEP]The King’s face[SEP]was slightly more fleshy than mine, the oval of its contour the least[SEP]trifle more pronounced, and, as I fancied, his mouth lacking something[SEP]of the firmness (or obstinacy) which was to be gathered from[SEP]my close-shutting lips.[SEP]But, for all that, and above all minor[SEP]distinctions, the likeness rose striking, salient, wonderful.[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt ceased speaking, and the King still frowned.[SEP]Then, gradually, the[SEP]corners of his mouth began to twitch, his nose came down (as mine[SEP]does when I laugh), his eyes twinkled, and, behold![SEP]he burst into the[SEP]merriest fit of irrepressible laughter, which rang through the woods and[SEP]proclaimed him a jovial soul.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well met, cousin![SEP]” he cried, stepping up to me, clapping me on the[SEP]back, and laughing still.[SEP]“You must forgive me if I was taken aback.[SEP]A[SEP]man doesn’t expect to see double at this time of day, eh, Fritz?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I must pray pardon, sire, for my presumption,” said I.[SEP]“I trust it will[SEP]not forfeit your Majesty’s favour.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“By Heaven![SEP]you’ll always enjoy the King’s countenance,” he laughed,[SEP]“whether I like it or not; and, sir, I shall very gladly add to it what[SEP]services I can.[SEP]Where are you travelling to?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“To Strelsau, sire--to the coronation.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The King looked at his friends: he still smiled, though his expression[SEP]hinted some uneasiness.[SEP]But the humorous side of the matter caught him[SEP]again.[EOT]
[SOT]“Fritz, Fritz![SEP]” he cried, “a thousand crowns for a sight of brother[SEP]Michael’s face when he sees a pair of us![SEP]” and the merry laugh rang out[SEP]again.[EOT]
[SOT]“Seriously,” observed Fritz von Tarlenheim, “I question Mr. Rassendyll’s[SEP]wisdom in visiting Strelsau just now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The King lit a cigarette.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, Sapt?[SEP]” said he, questioningly.[EOT]
[SOT]“He mustn’t go,” growled the old fellow.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come, colonel, you mean that I should be in Mr. Rassendyll’s debt,[SEP]if--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, ay![SEP]wrap it up in the right way,” said Sapt, hauling a great pipe[SEP]out of his pocket.[EOT]
[SOT]“Enough, sire,” said I.[SEP]“I’ll leave Ruritania today.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No, by thunder, you shan’t--and that’s sans phrase, as Sapt likes it.[SEP]For you shall dine with me tonight, happen what will afterwards.[SEP]Come,[SEP]man, you don’t meet a new relation every day![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“We dine sparingly tonight,” said Fritz von Tarlenheim.[EOT]
[SOT]“Not we--with our new cousin for a guest![SEP]” cried the King; and, as Fritz[SEP]shrugged his shoulders, he added: “Oh![SEP]I’ll remember our early start,[SEP]Fritz.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“So will I--tomorrow morning,” said old Sapt, pulling at his pipe.[EOT]
[SOT]“O wise old Sapt![SEP]” cried the King.[SEP]“Come, Mr. Rassendyll--by the way,[SEP]what name did they give you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Your Majesty’s,” I answered, bowing.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, that shows they weren’t ashamed of us,” he laughed.[SEP]“Come, then,[SEP]cousin Rudolf; I’ve got no house of my own here, but my dear brother[SEP]Michael lends us a place of his, and we’ll make shift to entertain you[SEP]there;” and he put his arm through mine and, signing to the others to[SEP]accompany us, walked me off, westerly, through the forest.[EOT]
[SOT]We walked for more than half an hour, and the King smoked cigarettes[SEP]and chattered incessantly.[SEP]He was full of interest in my family, laughed[SEP]heartily when I told him of the portraits with Elphberg hair in our[SEP]galleries, and yet more heartily when he heard that my expedition to[SEP]Ruritania was a secret one.[EOT]
[SOT]“You have to visit your disreputable cousin on the sly, have you?[SEP]” said[SEP]he.[EOT]
[SOT]Suddenly emerging from the wood, we came on a small and rude[SEP]hunting-lodge.[SEP]It was a one-storey building, a sort of bungalow, built[SEP]entirely of wood.[SEP]As we approached it, a little man in a plain livery[SEP]came out to meet us.[SEP]The only other person I saw about the place was[SEP]a fat elderly woman, whom I afterwards discovered to be the mother of[SEP]Johann, the duke’s keeper.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, is dinner ready, Josef?[SEP]” asked the King.[EOT]
[SOT]The little servant informed us that it was, and we soon sat down to a[SEP]plentiful meal.[SEP]The fare was plain enough: the King ate heartily, Fritz[SEP]von Tarlenheim delicately, old Sapt voraciously.[SEP]I played a good[SEP]knife and fork, as my custom is; the King noticed my performance with[SEP]approval.[EOT]
[SOT]“We’re all good trenchermen, we Elphbergs,” said he.[SEP]“But what?[SEP]--we’re[SEP]eating dry![SEP]Wine, Josef![SEP]wine, man![SEP]Are we beasts, to eat without[SEP]drinking?[SEP]Are we cattle, Josef?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]At this reproof Josef hastened to load the table with bottles.[EOT]
[SOT]“Remember tomorrow![SEP]” said Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay--tomorrow![SEP]” said old Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]The King drained a bumper to his “Cousin Rudolf,” as he was gracious--or[SEP]merry--enough to call me; and I drank its fellow to the “Elphberg Red,”[SEP]whereat he laughed loudly.[EOT]
[SOT]Now, be the meat what it might, the wine we drank was beyond all price[SEP]or praise, and we did it justice.[SEP]Fritz ventured once to stay the King’s[SEP]hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“What?[SEP]” cried the King.[SEP]“Remember you start before I do, Master[SEP]Fritz--you must be more sparing by two hours than I.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Fritz saw that I did not understand.[EOT]
[SOT]“The colonel and I,” he explained, “leave here at six: we ride down to[SEP]Zenda and return with the guard of honour to fetch the King at eight,[SEP]and then we all ride together to the station.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Hang that same guard![SEP]” growled Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh![SEP]it’s very civil of my brother to ask the honour for his regiment,”[SEP]said the King.[SEP]“Come, cousin, you need not start early.[SEP]Another bottle,[SEP]man![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I had another bottle--or, rather, a part of one, for the larger half[SEP]travelled quickly down his Majesty’s throat.[SEP]Fritz gave up his attempts[SEP]at persuasion: from persuading, he fell to being persuaded, and soon we[SEP]were all of us as full of wine as we had any right to be.[SEP]The King began[SEP]talking of what he would do in the future, old Sapt of what he had[SEP]done in the past, Fritz of some beautiful girl or other, and I of the[SEP]wonderful merits of the Elphberg dynasty.[SEP]We all talked at once, and[SEP]followed to the letter Sapt’s exhortation to let the morrow take care of[SEP]itself.[EOT]
[SOT]At last the King set down his glass and leant back in his chair.[EOT]
[SOT]“I have drunk enough,” said he.[EOT]
[SOT]“Far be it from me to contradict the King,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]Indeed, his remark was most absolutely true--so far as it went.[EOT]
[SOT]While I yet spoke, Josef came and set before the King a marvellous old[SEP]wicker-covered flagon.[SEP]It had lain so long in some darkened cellar that[SEP]it seemed to blink in the candlelight.[EOT]
[SOT]“His Highness the Duke of Strelsau bade me set this wine before the[SEP]King, when the King was weary of all other wines, and pray the King to[SEP]drink, for the love that he bears his brother.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well done, Black Michael![SEP]” said the King.[SEP]“Out with the cork, Josef.[SEP]Hang him![SEP]Did he think I’d flinch from his bottle?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The bottle was opened, and Josef filled the King’s glass.[SEP]The King[SEP]tasted it.[SEP]Then, with a solemnity born of the hour and his own[SEP]condition, he looked round on us:[EOT]
[SOT]“Gentlemen, my friends--Rudolf, my cousin [‘tis a scandalous story,[SEP]Rudolf, on my honour![SEP]), everything is yours to the half of Ruritania.[SEP]But ask me not for a single drop of this divine bottle, which I will[SEP]drink to the health of that--that sly knave, my brother, Black Michael.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]And the King seized the bottle and turned it over his mouth, and drained[SEP]it and flung it from him, and laid his head on his arms on the table.[EOT]
[SOT]And we drank pleasant dreams to his Majesty--and that is all I remember[SEP]of the evening.[SEP]Perhaps it is enough.[EOT]
[SOT]The King Keeps His Appointment[EOT]
[SOT]Whether I had slept a minute or a year I knew not.[SEP]I awoke with a start[SEP]and a shiver; my face, hair and clothes dripped water, and opposite me[SEP]stood old Sapt, a sneering smile on his face and an empty bucket in his[SEP]hand.[SEP]On the table by him sat Fritz von Tarlenheim, pale as a ghost and[SEP]black as a crow under the eyes.[EOT]
[SOT]I leapt to my feet in anger.[EOT]
[SOT]“Your joke goes too far, sir![SEP]” I cried.[EOT]
[SOT]“Tut, man, we’ve no time for quarrelling.[SEP]Nothing else would rouse you.[SEP]It’s five o’clock.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ll thank you, Colonel Sapt--” I began again, hot in spirit, though I[SEP]was uncommonly cold in body.[EOT]
[SOT]“Rassendyll,” interrupted Fritz, getting down from the table and taking[SEP]my arm, “look here.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The King lay full length on the floor.[SEP]His face was red as his hair,[SEP]and he breathed heavily.[SEP]Sapt, the disrespectful old dog, kicked him[SEP]sharply.[SEP]He did not stir, nor was there any break in his breathing.[SEP]I[SEP]saw that his face and head were wet with water, as were mine.[EOT]
[SOT]“We’ve spent half an hour on him,” said Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]“He drank three times what either of you did,” growled Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]I knelt down and felt his pulse.[SEP]It was alarmingly languid and slow.[SEP]We[SEP]three looked at one another.[EOT]
[SOT]“Was it drugged--that last bottle?[SEP]” I asked in a whisper.[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t know,” said Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“We must get a doctor.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“There’s none within ten miles, and a thousand doctors wouldn’t take[SEP]him to Strelsau today.[SEP]I know the look of it.[SEP]He’ll not move for six or[SEP]seven hours yet.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But the coronation![SEP]” I cried in horror.[EOT]
[SOT]Fritz shrugged his shoulders, as I began to see was his habit on most[SEP]occasions.[EOT]
[SOT]“We must send word that he’s ill,” he said.[EOT]
[SOT]“I suppose so,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]Old Sapt, who seemed as fresh as a daisy, had lit his pipe and was[SEP]puffing hard at it.[EOT]
[SOT]“If he’s not crowned today,” said he, “I’ll lay a crown he’s never[SEP]crowned.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But heavens, why?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The whole nation’s there to meet him; half the army--ay, and Black[SEP]Michael at the head.[SEP]Shall we send word that the King’s drunk?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That he’s ill,” said I, in correction.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ill![SEP]” echoed Sapt, with a scornful laugh.[SEP]“They know his illnesses too[SEP]well.[SEP]He’s been ‘ill’ before![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, we must chance what they think,” said Fritz helplessly.[SEP]“I’ll[SEP]carry the news and make the best of it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt raised his hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“Tell me,” said he.[SEP]“Do you think the King was drugged?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I do,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“And who drugged him?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That damned hound, Black Michael,” said Fritz between his teeth.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay,” said Sapt, “that he might not come to be crowned.[SEP]Rassendyll here[SEP]doesn’t know our pretty Michael.[SEP]What think you, Fritz, has Michael no[SEP]king ready?[SEP]Has half Strelsau no other candidate?[SEP]As God’s alive, man,[SEP]the throne’s lost if the King show himself not in Strelsau today.[SEP]I know[SEP]Black Michael.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“We could carry him there,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“And a very pretty picture he makes,” sneered Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]Fritz von Tarlenheim buried his face in his hands.[SEP]The King breathed[SEP]loudly and heavily.[SEP]Sapt stirred him again with his foot.[EOT]
[SOT]“The drunken dog![SEP]” he said; “but he’s an Elphberg and the son of his[SEP]father, and may I rot in hell before Black Michael sits in his place![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]For a moment or two we were all silent; then Sapt, knitting his bushy[SEP]grey brows, took his pipe from his mouth and said to me:[EOT]
[SOT]“As a man grows old he believes in Fate.[SEP]Fate sent you here.[SEP]Fate sends[SEP]you now to Strelsau.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I staggered back, murmuring “Good God![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Fritz looked up with an eager, bewildered gaze.[EOT]
[SOT]“Impossible![SEP]” I muttered.[SEP]“I should be known.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s a risk--against a certainty,” said Sapt.[SEP]“If you shave, I’ll wager[SEP]you’ll not be known.[SEP]Are you afraid?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Come, lad, there, there; but it’s your life, you know, if you’re[SEP]known--and mine--and Fritz’s here.[SEP]But, if you don’t go, I swear to you[SEP]Black Michael will sit tonight on the throne, and the King lie in prison[SEP]or his grave.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The King would never forgive it,” I stammered.[EOT]
[SOT]“Are we women?[SEP]Who cares for his forgiveness?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The clock ticked fifty times, and sixty and seventy times, as I stood in[SEP]thought.[SEP]Then I suppose a look came over my face, for old Sapt caught me[SEP]by the hand, crying:[EOT]
[SOT]“You’ll go?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, I’ll go,” said I, and I turned my eyes on the prostrate figure of[SEP]the King on the floor.[EOT]
[SOT]“Tonight,” Sapt went on in a hasty whisper, “we are to lodge in the[SEP]Palace.[SEP]The moment they leave us you and I will mount our horses--Fritz[SEP]must stay there and guard the King’s room--and ride here at a gallop.[SEP]The King will be ready--Josef will tell him--and he must ride back with[SEP]me to Strelsau, and you ride as if the devil were behind you to the[SEP]frontier.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I took it all in in a second, and nodded my head.[EOT]
[SOT]“There’s a chance,” said Fritz, with his first sign of hopefulness.[EOT]
[SOT]“If I escape detection,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“If we’re detected,” said Sapt.[SEP]“I’ll send Black Michael down below[SEP]before I go myself, so help me heaven![SEP]Sit in that chair, man.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I obeyed him.[EOT]
[SOT]He darted from the room, calling “Josef![SEP]Josef![SEP]” In three minutes he was[SEP]back, and Josef with him.[SEP]The latter carried a jug of hot water, soap[SEP]and razors.[SEP]He was trembling as Sapt told him how the land lay, and bade[SEP]him shave me.[EOT]
[SOT]Suddenly Fritz smote on his thigh:[EOT]
[SOT]“But the guard![SEP]They’ll know![SEP]they’ll know![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Pooh![SEP]We shan’t wait for the guard.[SEP]We’ll ride to Hofbau and catch a[SEP]train there.[SEP]When they come, the bird’ll be flown.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But the King?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The King will be in the wine-cellar.[SEP]I’m going to carry him there now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“If they find him?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“They won’t.[SEP]How should they?[SEP]Josef will put them off.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt stamped his foot.[EOT]
[SOT]“We’re not playing,” he roared.[SEP]“My God![SEP]don’t I know the risk?[SEP]If[SEP]they do find him, he’s no worse off than if he isn’t crowned today in[SEP]Strelsau.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]So speaking, he flung the door open and, stooping, put forth a strength[SEP]I did not dream he had, and lifted the King in his hands.[SEP]And as he did[SEP]so, the old woman, Johann the keeper’s mother, stood in the doorway.[SEP]For a moment she stood, then she turned on her heel, without a sign of[SEP]surprise, and clattered down the passage.[EOT]
[SOT]“Has she heard?[SEP]” cried Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ll shut her mouth![SEP]” said Sapt grimly, and he bore off the King in his[SEP]arms.[EOT]
[SOT]For me, I sat down in an armchair, and as I sat there, half-dazed, Josef[SEP]clipped and scraped me till my moustache and imperial were things of the[SEP]past and my face was as bare as the King’s.[SEP]And when Fritz saw me thus[SEP]he drew a long breath and exclaimed:--[EOT]
[SOT]“By Jove, we shall do it![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]It was six o’clock now, and we had no time to lose.[SEP]Sapt hurried me into[SEP]the King’s room, and I dressed myself in the uniform of a colonel of the[SEP]Guard, finding time as I slipped on the King’s boots to ask Sapt what he[SEP]had done with the old woman.[EOT]
[SOT]“She swore she’d heard nothing,” said he; “but to make sure I tied her[SEP]legs together and put a handkerchief in her mouth and bound her hands,[SEP]and locked her up in the coal-cellar, next door to the King.[SEP]Josef will[SEP]look after them both later on.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Then I burst out laughing, and even old Sapt grimly smiled.[EOT]
[SOT]“I fancy,” said he, “that when Josef tells them the King is gone they’ll[SEP]think it is because we smelt a rat.[SEP]For you may swear Black Michael[SEP]doesn’t expect to see him in Strelsau today.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I put the King’s helmet on my head.[SEP]Old Sapt handed me the King’s sword,[SEP]looking at me long and carefully.[EOT]
[SOT]“Thank God, he shaved his beard![SEP]” he exclaimed.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why did he?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Because Princess Flavia said he grazed her cheek when he was graciously[SEP]pleased to give her a cousinly kiss.[SEP]Come though, we must ride.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Is all safe here?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Nothing’s safe anywhere,” said Sapt, “but we can make it no safer.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Fritz now rejoined us in the uniform of a captain in the same regiment[SEP]as that to which my dress belonged.[SEP]In four minutes Sapt had arrayed[SEP]himself in his uniform.[SEP]Josef called that the horses were ready.[SEP]We[SEP]jumped on their backs and started at a rapid trot.[SEP]The game had begun.[SEP]What would the issue of it be?[EOT]
[SOT]The cool morning air cleared my head, and I was able to take in all[SEP]Sapt said to me.[SEP]He was wonderful.[SEP]Fritz hardly spoke, riding like a man[SEP]asleep, but Sapt, without another word for the King, began at once to[SEP]instruct me most minutely in the history of my past life, of my family,[SEP]of my tastes, pursuits, weaknesses, friends, companions, and servants.[SEP]He told me the etiquette of the Ruritanian Court, promising to be[SEP]constantly at my elbow to point out everybody whom I ought to know, and[SEP]give me hints with what degree of favour to greet them.[EOT]
[SOT]“By the way,” he said, “you’re a Catholic, I suppose?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Not I,” I answered.[EOT]
[SOT]“Lord, he’s a heretic![SEP]” groaned Sapt, and forthwith he fell to a[SEP]rudimentary lesson in the practices and observances of the Romish faith.[EOT]
[SOT]“Luckily,” said he, “you won’t be expected to know much, for the King’s[SEP]notoriously lax and careless about such matters.[SEP]But you must be as[SEP]civil as butter to the Cardinal.[SEP]We hope to win him over, because he and[SEP]Michael have a standing quarrel about their precedence.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]We were by now at the station.[SEP]Fritz had recovered nerve enough to[SEP]explain to the astonished station master that the King had changed his[SEP]plans.[SEP]The train steamed up.[SEP]We got into a first-class carriage, and[SEP]Sapt, leaning back on the cushions, went on with his lesson.[SEP]I looked at[SEP]my watch--the King’s watch it was, of course.[SEP]It was just eight.[EOT]
[SOT]“I wonder if they’ve gone to look for us,” I said.[EOT]
[SOT]“I hope they won’t find the King,” said Fritz nervously, and this time[SEP]it was Sapt who shrugged his shoulders.[EOT]
[SOT]The train travelled well, and at half-past nine, looking out of the[SEP]window, I saw the towers and spires of a great city.[EOT]
[SOT]“Your capital, my liege,” grinned old Sapt, with a wave of his hand,[SEP]and, leaning forward, he laid his finger on my pulse.[SEP]“A little too[SEP]quick,” said he, in his grumbling tone.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m not made of stone![SEP]” I exclaimed.[EOT]
[SOT]“You’ll do,” said he, with a nod.[SEP]“We must say Fritz here has caught the[SEP]ague.[SEP]Drain your flask, Fritz, for heaven’s sake, boy![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Fritz did as he was bid.[EOT]
[SOT]“We’re an hour early,” said Sapt.[SEP]“We’ll send word forward for your[SEP]Majesty’s arrival, for there’ll be no one here to meet us yet.[SEP]And[SEP]meanwhile--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Meanwhile,” said I, “the King’ll be hanged if he doesn’t have some[SEP]breakfast.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Old Sapt chuckled, and held out his hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“You’re an Elphberg, every inch of you,” said he.[SEP]Then he paused, and[SEP]looking at us, said quietly, “God send we may be alive tonight![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Amen![SEP]” said Fritz von Tarlenheim.[EOT]
[SOT]The train stopped.[SEP]Fritz and Sapt leapt out, uncovered, and held the[SEP]door for me.[SEP]I choked down a lump that rose in my throat, settled my[SEP]helmet firmly on my head, and (I’m not ashamed to say it) breathed a[SEP]short prayer to God.[SEP]Then I stepped on the platform of the station at[SEP]Strelsau.[EOT]
[SOT]A moment later, all was bustle and confusion: men hurrying up, hats[SEP]in hand, and hurrying off again; men conducting me to the buffet; men[SEP]mounting and riding in hot haste to the quarters of the troops, to the[SEP]Cathedral, to the residence of Duke Michael.[SEP]Even as I swallowed the[SEP]last drop of my cup of coffee, the bells throughout all the city broke[SEP]out into a joyful peal, and the sound of a military band and of men[SEP]cheering smote upon my ear.[EOT]
[SOT]King Rudolf the Fifth was in his good city of Strelsau![SEP]And they shouted[SEP]outside--[EOT]
[SOT]“God save the King![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Old Sapt’s mouth wrinkled into a smile.[EOT]
[SOT]“God save ’em both![SEP]” he whispered.[SEP]“Courage, lad![SEP]” and I felt his hand[SEP]press my knee.[EOT]
[SOT]The Adventures of an Understudy[EOT]
[SOT]With Fritz von Tarlenheim and Colonel Sapt close behind me, I stepped[SEP]out of the buffet on to the platform.[SEP]The last thing I did was to feel[SEP]if my revolver were handy and my sword loose in the scabbard.[SEP]A gay[SEP]group of officers and high dignitaries stood awaiting me, at their head[SEP]a tall old man, covered with medals, and of military bearing.[SEP]He wore[SEP]the yellow and red ribbon of the Red Rose of Ruritania--which, by the[SEP]way, decorated my unworthy breast also.[EOT]
[SOT]“Marshal Strakencz,” whispered Sapt, and I knew that I was in the[SEP]presence of the most famous veteran of the Ruritanian army.[EOT]
[SOT]Just behind the Marshal stood a short spare man, in flowing robes of[SEP]black and crimson.[EOT]
[SOT]“The Chancellor of the Kingdom,” whispered Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]The Marshal greeted me in a few loyal words, and proceeded to deliver[SEP]an apology from the Duke of Strelsau.[SEP]The duke, it seemed, had been[SEP]afflicted with a sudden indisposition which made it impossible for him[SEP]to come to the station, but he craved leave to await his Majesty at the[SEP]Cathedral.[SEP]I expressed my concern, accepted the Marshal’s excuses very[SEP]suavely, and received the compliments of a large number of distinguished[SEP]personages.[SEP]No one betrayed the least suspicion, and I felt my nerve[SEP]returning and the agitated beating of my heart subsiding.[SEP]But Fritz[SEP]was still pale, and his hand shook like a leaf as he extended it to the[SEP]Marshal.[EOT]
[SOT]Presently we formed procession and took our way to the door of the[SEP]station.[SEP]Here I mounted my horse, the Marshal holding my stirrup.[SEP]The[SEP]civil dignitaries went off to their carriages, and I started to ride[SEP]through the streets with the Marshal on my right and Sapt (who, as my[SEP]chief aide-de-camp, was entitled to the place) on my left.[SEP]The city of[SEP]Strelsau is partly old and partly new.[SEP]Spacious modern boulevards and[SEP]residential quarters surround and embrace the narrow, tortuous, and[SEP]picturesque streets of the original town.[SEP]In the outer circles the upper[SEP]classes live; in the inner the shops are situated; and, behind their[SEP]prosperous fronts, lie hidden populous but wretched lanes and alleys,[SEP]filled with a poverty-stricken, turbulent, and (in large measure)[SEP]criminal class.[SEP]These social and local divisions corresponded, as I knew[SEP]from Sapt’s information, to another division more important to me.[SEP]The[SEP]New Town was for the King; but to the Old Town Michael of Strelsau was a[SEP]hope, a hero, and a darling.[EOT]
[SOT]The scene was very brilliant as we passed along the Grand Boulevard and[SEP]on to the great square where the Royal Palace stood.[SEP]Here I was in[SEP]the midst of my devoted adherents.[SEP]Every house was hung with red and[SEP]bedecked with flags and mottoes.[SEP]The streets were lined with raised[SEP]seats on each side, and I passed along, bowing this way and that, under[SEP]a shower of cheers, blessings, and waving handkerchiefs.[SEP]The balconies[SEP]were full of gaily dressed ladies, who clapped their hands and curtsied[SEP]and threw their brightest glances at me.[SEP]A torrent of red roses fell on[SEP]me; one bloom lodged in my horse’s mane, and I took it and stuck it in[SEP]my coat.[SEP]The Marshal smiled grimly.[SEP]I had stolen some glances at his[SEP]face, but he was too impassive to show me whether his sympathies were[SEP]with me or not.[EOT]
[SOT]“The red rose for the Elphbergs, Marshal,” said I gaily, and he nodded.[EOT]
[SOT]I have written “gaily,” and a strange word it must seem.[SEP]But the truth[SEP]is, that I was drunk with excitement.[SEP]At that moment I believed--I[SEP]almost believed--that I was in very truth the King; and, with a look of[SEP]laughing triumph, I raised my eyes to the beauty-laden balconies again[SEP].[SEP].[SEP].[SEP]and then I started.[SEP]For, looking down on me, with her handsome[SEP]face and proud smile, was the lady who had been my fellow[SEP]traveller--Antoinette de Mauban; and I saw her also start, and her lips[SEP]moved, and she leant forward and gazed at me.[SEP]And I, collecting myself,[SEP]met her eyes full and square, while again I felt my revolver.[SEP]Suppose[SEP]she had cried aloud, “That’s not the King![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Well, we went by; and then the Marshal, turning round in his saddle,[SEP]waved his hand, and the Cuirassiers closed round us, so that the crowd[SEP]could not come near me.[SEP]We were leaving my quarter and entering Duke[SEP]Michael’s, and this action of the Marshal’s showed me more clearly than[SEP]words what the state of feeling in the town must be.[SEP]But if Fate made me[SEP]a King, the least I could do was to play the part handsomely.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why this change in our order, Marshal?[SEP]” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]The Marshal bit his white moustache.[EOT]
[SOT]“It is more prudent, sire,” he murmured.[EOT]
[SOT]I drew rein.[EOT]
[SOT]“Let those in front ride on,” said I, “till they are fifty yards ahead.[SEP]But do you, Marshal, and Colonel Sapt and my friends, wait here till[SEP]I have ridden fifty yards.[SEP]And see that no one is nearer to me.[SEP]I will[SEP]have my people see that their King trusts them.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt laid his hand on my arm.[SEP]I shook him off.[SEP]The Marshal hesitated.[EOT]
[SOT]“Am I not understood?[SEP]” said I; and, biting his moustache again, he gave[SEP]the orders.[SEP]I saw old Sapt smiling into his beard, but he shook his[SEP]head at me.[SEP]If I had been killed in open day in the streets of Strelsau,[SEP]Sapt’s position would have been a difficult one.[EOT]
[SOT]Perhaps I ought to say that I was dressed all in white, except my boots.[SEP]I wore a silver helmet with gilt ornaments, and the broad ribbon of the[SEP]Rose looked well across my chest.[SEP]I should be paying a poor compliment[SEP]to the King if I did not set modesty aside and admit that I made a very[SEP]fine figure.[SEP]So the people thought; for when I, riding alone, entered[SEP]the dingy, sparsely decorated, sombre streets of the Old Town, there[SEP]was first a murmur, then a cheer, and a woman, from a window above a[SEP]cookshop, cried the old local saying:[EOT]
[SOT]“If he’s red, he’s right![SEP]” whereat I laughed and took off my helmet that[SEP]she might see that I was of the right colour and they cheered me again[SEP]at that.[EOT]
[SOT]It was more interesting riding thus alone, for I heard the comments of[SEP]the crowd.[EOT]
[SOT]“He looks paler than his wont,” said one.[EOT]
[SOT]“You’d look pale if you lived as he does,” was the highly disrespectful[SEP]retort.[EOT]
[SOT]“He’s a bigger man than I thought,” said another.[EOT]
[SOT]“So he had a good jaw under that beard after all,” commented a third.[EOT]
[SOT]“The pictures of him aren’t handsome enough,” declared a pretty girl,[SEP]taking great care that I should hear.[SEP]No doubt it was mere flattery.[EOT]
[SOT]But, in spite of these signs of approval and interest, the mass of[SEP]the people received me in silence and with sullen looks, and my dear[SEP]brother’s portrait ornamented most of the windows--which was an ironical[SEP]sort of greeting to the King.[SEP]I was quite glad that he had been spared[SEP]the unpleasant sight.[SEP]He was a man of quick temper, and perhaps he would[SEP]not have taken it so placidly as I did.[EOT]
[SOT]At last we were at the Cathedral.[SEP]Its great grey front, embellished[SEP]with hundreds of statues and boasting a pair of the finest oak doors in[SEP]Europe, rose for the first time before me, and the sudden sense of my[SEP]audacity almost overcame me.[SEP]Everything was in a mist as I dismounted.[SEP]I[SEP]saw the Marshal and Sapt dimly, and dimly the throng of gorgeously robed[SEP]priests who awaited me.[SEP]And my eyes were still dim as I walked up the[SEP]great nave, with the pealing of the organ in my ears.[SEP]I saw nothing of[SEP]the brilliant throng that filled it, I hardly distinguished the stately[SEP]figure of the Cardinal as he rose from the archiepiscopal throne to[SEP]greet me.[SEP]Two faces only stood out side by side clearly before my[SEP]eyes--the face of a girl, pale and lovely, surmounted by a crown of the[SEP]glorious Elphberg hair (for in a woman it is glorious), and the face[SEP]of a man, whose full-blooded red cheeks, black hair, and dark deep eyes[SEP]told me that at last I was in the presence of my brother, Black Michael.[SEP]And[SEP]when he saw me his red cheeks went pale all in a moment, and his helmet[SEP]fell with a clatter on the floor.[SEP]Till that moment I believe that he had[SEP]not realized that the King was in very truth come to Strelsau.[EOT]
[SOT]Of what followed next I remember nothing.[SEP]I knelt before the altar and[SEP]the Cardinal anointed my head.[SEP]Then I rose to my feet, and stretched out[SEP]my hand and took from him the crown of Ruritania and set it on my head,[SEP]and I swore the old oath of the King; and (if it were a sin, may it be[SEP]forgiven me) I received the Holy Sacrament there before them all.[SEP]Then[SEP]the great organ pealed out again, the Marshal bade the heralds proclaim[SEP]me, and Rudolf the Fifth was crowned King; of which imposing ceremony an[SEP]excellent picture hangs now in my dining-room.[SEP]The portrait of the King[SEP]is very good.[EOT]
[SOT]Then the lady with the pale face and the glorious hair, her train held[SEP]by two pages, stepped from her place and came to where I stood.[SEP]And a[SEP]herald cried:[EOT]
[SOT]“Her Royal Highness the Princess Flavia![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She curtsied low, and put her hand under mine and raised my hand and[SEP]kissed it.[SEP]And for an instant I thought what I had best do.[SEP]Then I[SEP]drew her to me and kissed her twice on the cheek, and she blushed red,[SEP]and--then his Eminence the Cardinal Archbishop slipped in front of Black[SEP]Michael, and kissed my hand and presented me with a letter from the[SEP]Pope--the first and last which I have received from that exalted[SEP]quarter![EOT]
[SOT]And then came the Duke of Strelsau.[SEP]His step trembled, I swear, and[SEP]he looked to the right and to the left, as a man looks who thinks on[SEP]flight; and his face was patched with red and white, and his hand shook[SEP]so that it jumped under mine, and I felt his lips dry and parched.[SEP]And[SEP]I glanced at Sapt, who was smiling again into his beard, and, resolutely[SEP]doing my duty in that station of life to which I had been marvellously[SEP]called, I took my dear Michael by both hands and kissed him on the[SEP]cheek.[SEP]I think we were both glad when that was over![EOT]
[SOT]But neither in the face of the princess nor in that of any other did I[SEP]see the least doubt or questioning.[SEP]Yet, had I and the King stood side[SEP]by side, she could have told us in an instant, or, at least, on a little[SEP]consideration.[SEP]But neither she nor anyone else dreamed or imagined that[SEP]I could be other than the King.[SEP]So the likeness served, and for an hour[SEP]I stood there, feeling as weary and blase as though I had been a king[SEP]all my life; and everybody kissed my hand, and the ambassadors paid me[SEP]their respects, among them old Lord Topham, at whose house in Grosvenor[SEP]Square I had danced a score of times.[SEP]Thank heaven, the old man was as[SEP]blind as a bat, and did not claim my acquaintance.[EOT]
[SOT]Then back we went through the streets to the Palace, and I heard them[SEP]cheering Black Michael; but he, Fritz told me, sat biting his nails like[SEP]a man in a reverie, and even his own friends said that he should have[SEP]made a braver show.[SEP]I was in a carriage now, side by side with the[SEP]Princess Flavia, and a rough fellow cried out:[EOT]
[SOT]“And when’s the wedding?[SEP]” and as he spoke another struck him in the[SEP]face, crying “Long live Duke Michael![SEP]” and the princess coloured--it was[SEP]an admirable tint--and looked straight in front of her.[EOT]
[SOT]Now I felt in a difficulty, because I had forgotten to ask Sapt the[SEP]state of my affections, or how far matters had gone between the princess[SEP]and myself.[SEP]Frankly, had I been the King, the further they had gone the[SEP]better should I have been pleased.[SEP]For I am not a slow-blooded man, and[SEP]I had not kissed Princess Flavia’s cheek for nothing.[SEP]These thoughts[SEP]passed through my head, but, not being sure of my ground, I said[SEP]nothing; and in a moment or two the princess, recovering her equanimity,[SEP]turned to me.[EOT]
[SOT]“Do you know, Rudolf,” said she, “you look somehow different today?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The fact was not surprising, but the remark was disquieting.[EOT]
[SOT]“You look,” she went on, “more sober, more sedate; you’re almost[SEP]careworn, and I declare you’re thinner.[SEP]Surely it’s not possible that[SEP]you’ve begun to take anything seriously?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The princess seemed to hold of the King much the same opinion that Lady[SEP]Burlesdon held of me.[EOT]
[SOT]I braced myself up to the conversation.[EOT]
[SOT]“Would that please you?[SEP]” I asked softly.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, you know my views,” said she, turning her eyes away.[EOT]
[SOT]“Whatever pleases you I try to do,” I said; and, as I saw her smile and[SEP]blush, I thought that I was playing the King’s hand very well for him.[SEP]So I continued and what I said was perfectly true:[EOT]
[SOT]“I assure you, my dear cousin, that nothing in my life has affected me[SEP]more than the reception I’ve been greeted with today.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She smiled brightly, but in an instant grew grave again, and whispered:[EOT]
[SOT]“Did you notice Michael?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes,” said I, adding, “he wasn’t enjoying himself.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Do be careful![SEP]” she went on.[SEP]“You don’t--indeed you don’t--keep enough[SEP]watch on him.[SEP]You know--”[EOT]
[SOT]“I know,” said I, “that he wants what I’ve got.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes.[SEP]Hush![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Then--and I can’t justify it, for I committed the King far beyond what I[SEP]had a right to do--I suppose she carried me off my feet--I went on:[EOT]
[SOT]“And perhaps also something which I haven’t got yet, but hope to win[SEP]some day.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]This was my answer.[SEP]Had I been the King, I should have thought it[SEP]encouraging:[EOT]
[SOT]“Haven’t you enough responsibilities on you for one day, cousin?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Bang, bang![SEP]Blare, blare![SEP]We were at the Palace.[SEP]Guns were firing[SEP]and trumpets blowing.[SEP]Rows of lackeys stood waiting, and, handing the[SEP]princess up the broad marble staircase, I took formal possession, as[SEP]a crowned King, of the House of my ancestors, and sat down at my own[SEP]table, with my cousin on my right hand, on her other side Black Michael,[SEP]and on my left his Eminence the Cardinal.[SEP]Behind my chair stood Sapt;[SEP]and at the end of the table, I saw Fritz von Tarlenheim drain to the[SEP]bottom his glass of champagne rather sooner than he decently should.[EOT]
[SOT]I wondered what the King of Ruritania was doing.[EOT]
[SOT]The Secret of a Cellar[EOT]
[SOT]We were in the King’s dressing-room--Fritz von Tarlenheim, Sapt, and I.[SEP]I flung myself exhausted into an armchair.[SEP]Sapt lit his pipe.[SEP]He uttered[SEP]no congratulations on the marvellous success of our wild risk, but his[SEP]whole bearing was eloquent of satisfaction.[SEP]The triumph, aided perhaps[SEP]by good wine, had made a new man of Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]“What a day for you to remember![SEP]” he cried.[SEP]“Gad, I’d like to be King[SEP]for twelve hours myself![SEP]But, Rassendyll, you mustn’t throw your heart[SEP]too much into the part.[SEP]I don’t wonder Black Michael looked blacker than[SEP]ever--you and the princess had so much to say to one another.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“How beautiful she is![SEP]” I exclaimed.[EOT]
[SOT]“Never mind the woman,” growled Sapt.[SEP]“Are you ready to start?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes,” said I, with a sigh.[EOT]
[SOT]It was five o’clock, and at twelve I should be no more than Rudolf[SEP]Rassendyll.[SEP]I remarked on it in a joking tone.[EOT]
[SOT]“You’ll be lucky,” observed Sapt grimly, “if you’re not the late Rudolf[SEP]Rassendyll.[SEP]By Heaven![SEP]I feel my head wobbling on my shoulders every[SEP]minute you’re in the city.[SEP]Do you know, friend, that Michael has had[SEP]news from Zenda?[SEP]He went into a room alone to read it--and he came out[SEP]looking like a man dazed.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m ready,” said I, this news making me none the more eager to linger.[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt sat down.[EOT]
[SOT]“I must write us an order to leave the city.[SEP]Michael’s Governor, you[SEP]know, and we must be prepared for hindrances.[SEP]You must sign the order.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“My dear colonel, I’ve not been bred a forger![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Out of his pocket Sapt produced a piece of paper.[EOT]
[SOT]“There’s the King’s signature,” he said, “and here,” he went on, after[SEP]another search in his pocket, “is some tracing paper.[SEP]If you can’t[SEP]manage a ‘Rudolf’ in ten minutes, why--I can.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Your education has been more comprehensive than mine,” said I.[SEP]“You[SEP]write it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]And a very tolerable forgery did this versatile hero produce.[EOT]
[SOT]“Now, Fritz,” said he, “the King goes to bed.[SEP]He is upset.[SEP]No one is to[SEP]see him till nine o’clock tomorrow.[SEP]You understand--no one?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I understand,” answered Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]“Michael may come, and claim immediate audience.[SEP]You’ll answer that only[SEP]princes of the blood are entitled to it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That’ll annoy Michael,” laughed Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]“You quite understand?[SEP]” asked Sapt again.[SEP]“If the door of this room is[SEP]opened while we’re away, you’re not to be alive to tell us about it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I need no schooling, colonel,” said Fritz, a trifle haughtily.[EOT]
[SOT]“Here, wrap yourself in this big cloak,” Sapt continued to me, “and[SEP]put on this flat cap.[SEP]My orderly rides with me to the hunting-lodge[SEP]tonight.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“There’s an obstacle,” I observed.[SEP]“The horse doesn’t live that can[SEP]carry me forty miles.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, yes, he does--two of him: one here--one at the lodge.[SEP]Now, are you[SEP]ready?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m ready,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]Fritz held out his hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“In case,” said he; and we shook hands heartily.[EOT]
[SOT]“Damn your sentiment![SEP]” growled Sapt.[SEP]“Come along.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He went, not to the door, but to a panel in the wall.[EOT]
[SOT]“In the old King’s time,” said he, “I knew this way well.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I followed him, and we walked, as I should estimate, near two hundred[SEP]yards along a narrow passage.[SEP]Then we came to a stout oak door.[SEP]Sapt[SEP]unlocked it.[SEP]We passed through, and found ourselves in a quiet street[SEP]that ran along the back of the Palace gardens.[SEP]A man was waiting for us[SEP]with two horses.[SEP]One was a magnificent bay, up to any weight; the other[SEP]a sturdy brown.[SEP]Sapt signed to me to mount the bay.[SEP]Without a word[SEP]to the man, we mounted and rode away.[SEP]The town was full of noise and[SEP]merriment, but we took secluded ways.[SEP]My cloak was wrapped over half[SEP]my face; the capacious flat cap hid every lock of my tell-tale hair.[SEP]By[SEP]Sapt’s directions, I crouched on my saddle, and rode with such a round[SEP]back as I hope never to exhibit on a horse again.[SEP]Down a long narrow[SEP]lane we went, meeting some wanderers and some roisterers; and, as we[SEP]rode, we heard the Cathedral bells still clanging out their welcome to[SEP]the King.[SEP]It was half-past six, and still light.[SEP]At last we came to the[SEP]city wall and to a gate.[EOT]
[SOT]“Have your weapon ready,” whispered Sapt.[SEP]“We must stop his mouth, if he[SEP]talks.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I put my hand on my revolver.[SEP]Sapt hailed the doorkeeper.[SEP]The stars[SEP]fought for us![SEP]A little girl of fourteen tripped out.[EOT]
[SOT]“Please, sir, father’s gone to see the King.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He’d better have stayed here,” said Sapt to me, grinning.[EOT]
[SOT]“But he said I wasn’t to open the gate, sir.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Did he, my dear?[SEP]” said Sapt, dismounting.[SEP]“Then give me the key.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The key was in the child’s hand.[SEP]Sapt gave her a crown.[EOT]
[SOT]“Here’s an order from the King.[SEP]Show it to your father.[SEP]Orderly, open[SEP]the gate![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I leapt down.[SEP]Between us we rolled back the great gate, led our horses[SEP]out, and closed it again.[EOT]
[SOT]“I shall be sorry for the doorkeeper if Michael finds out that he wasn’t[SEP]there.[SEP]Now then, lad, for a canter.[SEP]We mustn’t go too fast while we’re[SEP]near the town.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Once, however, outside the city, we ran little danger, for everybody[SEP]else was inside, merry-making; and as the evening fell we quickened our[SEP]pace, my splendid horse bounding along under me as though I had been a[SEP]feather.[SEP]It was a fine night, and presently the moon appeared.[SEP]We talked[SEP]little on the way, and chiefly about the progress we were making.[EOT]
[SOT]“I wonder what the duke’s despatches told him,” said I, once.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, I wonder![SEP]” responded Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]We stopped for a draught of wine and to bait our horses, losing half an[SEP]hour thus.[SEP]I dared not go into the inn, and stayed with the horses[SEP]in the stable.[SEP]Then we went ahead again, and had covered some[SEP]five-and-twenty miles, when Sapt abruptly stopped.[EOT]
[SOT]“Hark![SEP]” he cried.[EOT]
[SOT]I listened.[SEP]Away, far behind us, in the still of the evening--it was[SEP]just half-past nine--we heard the beat of horses’ hoofs.[SEP]The wind[SEP]blowing strong behind us, carried the sound.[SEP]I glanced at Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come on![SEP]” he cried, and spurred his horse into a gallop.[SEP]When we next[SEP]paused to listen, the hoof-beats were not audible, and we relaxed our[SEP]pace.[SEP]Then we heard them again.[SEP]Sapt jumped down and laid his ear to the[SEP]ground.[EOT]
[SOT]“There are two,” he said.[SEP]“They’re only a mile behind.[SEP]Thank God the[SEP]road curves in and out, and the wind’s our way.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]We galloped on.[SEP]We seemed to be holding our own.[SEP]We had entered the[SEP]outskirts of the forest of Zenda, and the trees, closing in behind us as[SEP]the track zigged and zagged, prevented us seeing our pursuers, and them[SEP]from seeing us.[EOT]
[SOT]Another half-hour brought us to a divide of the road.[SEP]Sapt drew rein.[EOT]
[SOT]“To the right is our road,” he said.[SEP]“To the left, to the Castle.[SEP]Each[SEP]about eight miles.[SEP]Get down.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But they’ll be on us![SEP]” I cried.[EOT]
[SOT]“Get down![SEP]” he repeated brusquely; and I obeyed.[SEP]The wood was dense up[SEP]to the very edge of the road.[SEP]We led our horses into the covert, bound[SEP]handkerchiefs over their eyes, and stood beside them.[EOT]
[SOT]“You want to see who they are?[SEP]” I whispered.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, and where they’re going,” he answered.[EOT]
[SOT]I saw that his revolver was in his hand.[EOT]
[SOT]Nearer and nearer came the hoofs.[SEP]The moon shone out now clear and full,[SEP]so that the road was white with it.[SEP]The ground was hard, and we had left[SEP]no traces.[EOT]
[SOT]“Here they come![SEP]” whispered Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s the duke![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I thought so,” he answered.[EOT]
[SOT]It was the duke; and with him a burly fellow whom I knew well, and who[SEP]had cause to know me afterwards--Max Holf, brother to Johann the keeper,[SEP]and body-servant to his Highness.[SEP]They were up to us: the duke reined[SEP]up.[SEP]I saw Sapt’s finger curl lovingly towards the trigger.[SEP]I believe[SEP]he would have given ten years of his life for a shot; and he could have[SEP]picked off Black Michael as easily as I could a barn-door fowl in a[SEP]farmyard.[SEP]I laid my hand on his arm.[SEP]He nodded reassuringly: he was[SEP]always ready to sacrifice inclination to duty.[EOT]
[SOT]“Which way?[SEP]” asked Black Michael.[EOT]
[SOT]“To the Castle, your Highness,” urged his companion.[SEP]“There we shall[SEP]learn the truth.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]For an instant the duke hesitated.[EOT]
[SOT]“I thought I heard hoofs,” said he.[EOT]
[SOT]“I think not, your Highness.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why shouldn’t we go to the lodge?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I fear a trap.[SEP]If all is well, why go to the lodge?[SEP]If not, it’s a[SEP]snare to trap us.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Suddenly the duke’s horse neighed.[SEP]In an instant we folded our cloaks[SEP]close round our horses’ heads, and, holding them thus, covered the duke[SEP]and his attendant with our revolvers.[SEP]If they had found us, they had[SEP]been dead men, or our prisoners.[EOT]
[SOT]Michael waited a moment longer.[SEP]Then he cried:[EOT]
[SOT]“To Zenda, then![SEP]” and setting spurs to his horse, galloped on.[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt raised his weapon after him, and there was such an expression[SEP]of wistful regret on his face that I had much ado not to burst out[SEP]laughing.[EOT]
[SOT]For ten minutes we stayed where we were.[EOT]
[SOT]“You see,” said Sapt, “they’ve sent him news that all is well.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What does that mean?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“God knows,” said Sapt, frowning heavily.[SEP]“But it’s brought him from[SEP]Strelsau in a rare puzzle.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Then we mounted, and rode as fast as our weary horses could lay their[SEP]feet to the ground.[SEP]For those last eight miles we spoke no more.[SEP]Our[SEP]minds were full of apprehension.[SEP]“All is well.[SEP]” What did it mean?[SEP]Was[SEP]all well with the King?[EOT]
[SOT]At last the lodge came in sight.[SEP]Spurring our horses to a last gallop,[SEP]we rode up to the gate.[SEP]All was still and quiet.[SEP]Not a soul came to meet[SEP]us.[SEP]We dismounted in haste.[SEP]Suddenly Sapt caught me by the arm.[EOT]
[SOT]“Look there![SEP]” he said, pointing to the ground.[EOT]
[SOT]I looked down.[SEP]At my feet lay five or six silk handkerchiefs, torn and[SEP]slashed and rent.[SEP]I turned to him questioningly.[EOT]
[SOT]“They’re what I tied the old woman up with,” said he.[SEP]“Fasten the[SEP]horses, and come along.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The handle of the door turned without resistance.[SEP]We passed into the[SEP]room which had been the scene of last night’s bout.[SEP]It was still strewn[SEP]with the remnants of our meal and with empty bottles.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come on,” cried Sapt, whose marvellous composure had at last almost[SEP]given way.[EOT]
[SOT]We rushed down the passage towards the cellars.[SEP]The door of the[SEP]coal-cellar stood wide open.[EOT]
[SOT]“They found the old woman,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“You might have known that from the handkerchiefs,” he said.[EOT]
[SOT]Then we came opposite the door of the wine-cellar.[SEP]It was shut.[SEP]It[SEP]looked in all respects as it had looked when we left it that morning.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come, it’s all right,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]A loud oath from Sapt rang out.[SEP]His face turned pale, and he pointed[SEP]again at the floor.[SEP]From under the door a red stain had spread over the[SEP]floor of the passage and dried there.[SEP]Sapt sank against the opposite[SEP]wall.[SEP]I tried the door.[SEP]It was locked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Where’s Josef?[SEP]” muttered Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“Where’s the King?[SEP]” I responded.[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt took out a flask and put it to his lips.[SEP]I ran back to the[SEP]dining-room, and seized a heavy poker from the fireplace.[SEP]In my terror[SEP]and excitement I rained blows on the lock of the door, and I fired a[SEP]cartridge into it.[SEP]It gave way, and the door swung open.[EOT]
[SOT]“Give me a light,” said I; but Sapt still leant against the wall.[EOT]
[SOT]He was, of course, more moved than I, for he loved his master.[SEP]Afraid[SEP]for himself he was not--no man ever saw him that; but to think what[SEP]might lie in that dark cellar was enough to turn any man’s face pale.[SEP]I went myself, and took a silver candlestick from the dining-table and[SEP]struck a light, and, as I returned, I felt the hot wax drip on my naked[SEP]hand as the candle swayed to and fro; so that I cannot afford to despise[SEP]Colonel Sapt for his agitation.[EOT]
[SOT]I came to the door of the cellar.[SEP]The red stain turning more and more to[SEP]a dull brown, stretched inside.[SEP]I walked two yards into the cellar, and[SEP]held the candle high above my head.[SEP]I saw the full bins of wine; I saw[SEP]spiders crawling on the walls; I saw, too, a couple of empty bottles[SEP]lying on the floor; and then, away in the corner, I saw the body of a[SEP]man, lying flat on his back, with his arms stretched wide, and a crimson[SEP]gash across his throat.[SEP]I walked to him and knelt down beside him, and[SEP]commended to God the soul of a faithful man.[SEP]For it was the body of[SEP]Josef, the little servant, slain in guarding the King.[EOT]
[SOT]I felt a hand on my shoulders, and, turning, saw Sapt, eyes glaring and[SEP]terror-struck, beside me.[EOT]
[SOT]“The King?[SEP]My God![SEP]the King?[SEP]” he whispered hoarsely.[EOT]
[SOT]I threw the candle’s gleam over every inch of the cellar.[EOT]
[SOT]“The King is not here,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]His Majesty Sleeps in Strelsau[EOT]
[SOT]I put my arm round Sapt’s waist and supported him out of the cellar,[SEP]drawing the battered door close after me.[SEP]For ten minutes or more we sat[SEP]silent in the dining-room.[SEP]Then old Sapt rubbed his knuckles into his[SEP]eyes, gave one great gasp, and was himself again.[SEP]As the clock on the[SEP]mantelpiece struck one he stamped his foot on the floor, saying:[EOT]
[SOT]“They’ve got the King![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes,” said I, “‘all’s well![SEP]’ as Black Michael’s despatch said.[SEP]What[SEP]a moment it must have been for him when the royal salutes fired at[SEP]Strelsau this morning![SEP]I wonder when he got the message?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It must have been sent in the morning,” said Sapt.[SEP]“They must have sent[SEP]it before news of your arrival at Strelsau reached Zenda--I suppose it[SEP]came from Zenda.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And he’s carried it about all day![SEP]” I exclaimed.[SEP]“Upon my honour, I’m[SEP]not the only man who’s had a trying day![SEP]What did he think, Sapt?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What does that matter?[SEP]What does he think, lad, now?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I rose to my feet.[EOT]
[SOT]“We must get back,” I said, “and rouse every soldier in Strelsau.[SEP]We[SEP]ought to be in pursuit of Michael before midday.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Old Sapt pulled out his pipe and carefully lit it from the candle which[SEP]guttered on the table.[EOT]
[SOT]“The King may be murdered while we sit here![SEP]” I urged.[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt smoked on for a moment in silence.[EOT]
[SOT]“That cursed old woman![SEP]” he broke out.[SEP]“She must have attracted their[SEP]attention somehow.[SEP]I see the game.[SEP]They came up to kidnap the King,[SEP]and--as I say--somehow they found him.[SEP]If you hadn’t gone to Strelsau,[SEP]you and I and Fritz had been in heaven by now![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And the King?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Who knows where the King is now?[SEP]” he asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come, let’s be off![SEP]” said I; but he sat still.[SEP]And suddenly he burst[SEP]into one of his grating chuckles:[EOT]
[SOT]“By Jove, we’ve shaken up Black Michael![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Come, come![SEP]” I repeated impatiently.[EOT]
[SOT]“And we’ll shake him up a bit more,” he added, a cunning smile[SEP]broadening on his wrinkled, weather-beaten face, and his teeth working[SEP]on an end of his grizzled moustache.[SEP]“Ay, lad, we’ll go back to[SEP]Strelsau.[SEP]The King shall be in his capital again tomorrow.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The King?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The crowned King![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You’re mad![SEP]” I cried.[EOT]
[SOT]“If we go back and tell the trick we played, what would you give for our[SEP]lives?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Just what they’re worth,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“And for the King’s throne?[SEP]Do you think that the nobles and the people[SEP]will enjoy being fooled as you’ve fooled them?[SEP]Do you think they’ll love[SEP]a King who was too drunk to be crowned, and sent a servant to personate[SEP]him?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He was drugged--and I’m no servant.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Mine will be Black Michael’s version.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He rose, came to me, and laid his hand on my shoulder.[EOT]
[SOT]“Lad,” he said, “if you play the man, you may save the King yet.[SEP]Go back[SEP]and keep his throne warm for him.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But the duke knows--the villains he has employed know--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, but they can’t speak![SEP]” roared Sapt in grim triumph.[EOT]
[SOT]“We’ve got ’em![SEP]How can they denounce you without denouncing themselves?[SEP]This is not the King, because we kidnapped the King and murdered his[SEP]servant.[SEP]Can they say that?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The position flashed on me.[SEP]Whether Michael knew me or not, he could not[SEP]speak.[SEP]Unless he produced the King, what could he do?[SEP]And if he produced[SEP]the King, where was he?[SEP]For a moment I was carried away headlong; but in[SEP]an instant the difficulties came strong upon me.[EOT]
[SOT]“I must be found out,” I urged.[EOT]
[SOT]“Perhaps; but every hour’s something.[SEP]Above all, we must have a King in[SEP]Strelsau, or the city will be Michael’s in four-and-twenty hours, and[SEP]what would the King’s life be worth then--or his throne?[SEP]Lad, you must[SEP]do it![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Suppose they kill the King?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“They’ll kill him, if you don’t.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Sapt, suppose they have killed the King?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Then, by heaven, you’re as good an Elphberg as Black Michael, and you[SEP]shall reign in Ruritania![SEP]But I don’t believe they have; nor will they[SEP]kill him if you’re on the throne.[SEP]Will they kill him, to put you in?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]It was a wild plan--wilder even and more hopeless than the trick we[SEP]had already carried through; but as I listened to Sapt I saw the strong[SEP]points in our game.[SEP]And then I was a young man and I loved action, and I[SEP]was offered such a hand in such a game as perhaps never man played yet.[EOT]
[SOT]“I shall be found out,” I said.[EOT]
[SOT]“Perhaps,” said Sapt.[SEP]“Come![SEP]to Strelsau![SEP]We shall be caught like rats[SEP]in a trap if we stay here.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Sapt,” I cried, “I’ll try it![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well played![SEP]” said he.[SEP]“I hope they’ve left us the horses.[SEP]I’ll go and[SEP]see.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“We must bury that poor fellow,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“No time,” said Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ll do it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Hang you![SEP]” he grinned.[SEP]“I make you a King, and--Well, do it.[SEP]Go and[SEP]fetch him, while I look to the horses.[SEP]He can’t lie very deep, but I[SEP]doubt if he’ll care about that.[SEP]Poor little Josef![SEP]He was an honest bit[SEP]of a man.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He went out, and I went to the cellar.[SEP]I raised poor Josef in my arms[SEP]and bore him into the passage and thence towards the door of the house.[SEP]Just inside I laid him down, remembering that I must find spades for our[SEP]task.[SEP]At this instant Sapt came up.[EOT]
[SOT]“The horses are all right; there’s the own brother to the one that[SEP]brought you here.[SEP]But you may save yourself that job.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ll not go before he’s buried.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, you will.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Not I, Colonel Sapt; not for all Ruritania.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You fool![SEP]” said he.[SEP]“Come here.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He drew me to the door.[SEP]The moon was sinking, but about three hundred[SEP]yards away, coming along the road from Zenda, I made out a party of men.[SEP]There were seven or eight of them; four were on horseback and the rest[SEP]were walking, and I saw that they carried long implements, which I[SEP]guessed to be spades and mattocks, on their shoulders.[EOT]
[SOT]“They’ll save you the trouble,” said Sapt.[SEP]“Come along.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He was right.[SEP]The approaching party must, beyond doubt, be Duke[SEP]Michael’s men, come to remove the traces of their evil work.[SEP]I hesitated[SEP]no longer, but an irresistible desire seized me.[EOT]
[SOT]Pointing to the corpse of poor little Josef, I said to Sapt:[EOT]
[SOT]“Colonel, we ought to strike a blow for him![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You’d like to give him some company, eh![SEP]But it’s too risky work, your[SEP]Majesty.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I must have a slap at ’em,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt wavered.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well,” said he, “it’s not business, you know; but you’ve been a good[SEP]boy--and if we come to grief, why, hang me, it’ll save us lot of[SEP]thinking![SEP]I’ll show you how to touch them.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He cautiously closed the open chink of the door.[EOT]
[SOT]Then we retreated through the house and made our way to the back[SEP]entrance.[SEP]Here our horses were standing.[SEP]A carriage-drive swept all[SEP]round the lodge.[EOT]
[SOT]“Revolver ready?[SEP]” asked Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“No; steel for me,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“Gad, you’re thirsty tonight,” chuckled Sapt.[SEP]“So be it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]We mounted, drawing our swords, and waited silently for a minute or two.[SEP]Then we heard the tramp of men on the drive the other side of the house.[SEP]They came to a stand, and one cried:[EOT]
[SOT]“Now then, fetch him out![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Now![SEP]” whispered Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]Driving the spurs into our horses, we rushed at a gallop round the[SEP]house, and in a moment we were among the ruffians.[SEP]Sapt told me[SEP]afterwards that he killed a man, and I believe him; but I saw no more of[SEP]him.[SEP]With a cut, I split the head of a fellow on a brown horse, and he[SEP]fell to the ground.[SEP]Then I found myself opposite a big man, and I was[SEP]half conscious of another to my right.[SEP]It was too warm to stay, and with[SEP]a simultaneous action I drove my spurs into my horse again and my sword[SEP]full into the big man’s breast.[SEP]His bullet whizzed past my ear--I could[SEP]almost swear it touched it.[SEP]I wrenched at the sword, but it would not[SEP]come, and I dropped it and galloped after Sapt, whom I now saw about[SEP]twenty yards ahead.[SEP]I waved my hand in farewell, and dropped it a second[SEP]later with a yell, for a bullet had grazed my finger and I felt the[SEP]blood.[SEP]Old Sapt turned round in the saddle.[SEP]Someone fired again, but[SEP]they had no rifles, and we were out of range.[SEP]Sapt fell to laughing.[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s one to me and two to you, with decent luck,” said he.[SEP]“Little[SEP]Josef will have company.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, they’ll be a _parti carrée_,” said I.[SEP]My blood was up, and I[SEP]rejoiced to have killed them.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, a pleasant night’s work to the rest![SEP]” said he.[SEP]“I wonder if they[SEP]noticed you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The big fellow did; as I stuck him I heard him cry, ‘The King![SEP]’”[EOT]
[SOT]“Good![SEP]good![SEP]Oh, we’ll give Black Michael some work before we’ve done![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Pausing an instant, we made a bandage for my wounded finger, which was[SEP]bleeding freely and ached severely, the bone being much bruised.[SEP]Then we[SEP]rode on, asking of our good horses all that was in them.[SEP]The excitement[SEP]of the fight and of our great resolve died away, and we rode in gloomy[SEP]silence.[SEP]Day broke clear and cold.[SEP]We found a farmer just up, and made[SEP]him give us sustenance for ourselves and our horses.[SEP]I, feigning a[SEP]toothache, muffled my face closely.[SEP]Then ahead again, till Strelsau lay[SEP]before us.[SEP]It was eight o’clock or nearing nine, and the gates were all[SEP]open, as they always were save when the duke’s caprice or intrigues shut[SEP]them.[SEP]We rode in by the same way as we had come out the evening before,[SEP]all four of us--the men and the horses--wearied and jaded.[SEP]The streets[SEP]were even quieter than when we had gone: everyone was sleeping off last[SEP]night’s revelry, and we met hardly a soul till we reached the little[SEP]gate of the Palace.[SEP]There Sapt’s old groom was waiting for us.[EOT]
[SOT]“Is all well, sir?[SEP]” he asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“All’s well,” said Sapt, and the man, coming to me, took my hand to[SEP]kiss.[EOT]
[SOT]“The King’s hurt![SEP]” he cried.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s nothing,” said I, as I dismounted; “I caught my finger in the[SEP]door.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Remember--silence![SEP]” said Sapt.[SEP]“Ah![SEP]but, my good Freyler, I do not need[SEP]to tell you that![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The old fellow shrugged his shoulders.[EOT]
[SOT]“All young men like to ride abroad now and again, why not the King?[SEP]”[SEP]said he; and Sapt’s laugh left his opinion of my motives undisturbed.[EOT]
[SOT]“You should always trust a man,” observed Sapt, fitting the key in the[SEP]lock, “just as far as you must.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]We went in and reached the dressing-room.[SEP]Flinging open the door, we saw[SEP]Fritz von Tarlenheim stretched, fully dressed, on the sofa.[SEP]He seemed to[SEP]have been sleeping, but our entry woke him.[SEP]He leapt to his feet, gave[SEP]one glance at me, and with a joyful cry, threw himself on his knees[SEP]before me.[EOT]
[SOT]“Thank God, sire![SEP]thank God, you’re safe![SEP]” he cried, stretching his hand[SEP]up to catch hold of mine.[EOT]
[SOT]I confess that I was moved.[SEP]This King, whatever his faults, made people[SEP]love him.[SEP]For a moment I could not bear to speak or break the poor[SEP]fellow’s illusion.[SEP]But tough old Sapt had no such feeling.[SEP]He slapped[SEP]his hand on his thigh delightedly.[EOT]
[SOT]“Bravo, lad![SEP]” cried he.[SEP]“We shall do![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Fritz looked up in bewilderment.[SEP]I held out my hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“You’re wounded, sire![SEP]” he exclaimed.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s only a scratch,” said I, “but--” I paused.[EOT]
[SOT]He rose to his feet with a bewildered air.[SEP]Holding my hand, he looked[SEP]me up and down, and down and up.[SEP]Then suddenly he dropped my hand and[SEP]reeled back.[EOT]
[SOT]“Where’s the King?[SEP]Where’s the King?[SEP]” he cried.[EOT]
[SOT]“Hush, you fool![SEP]” hissed Sapt.[SEP]“Not so loud![SEP]Here’s the King![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]A knock sounded on the door.[SEP]Sapt seized me by the hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“Here, quick, to the bedroom![SEP]Off with your cap and boots.[SEP]Get into bed.[SEP]Cover everything up.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I did as I was bid.[SEP]A moment later Sapt looked in, nodded, grinned, and[SEP]introduced an extremely smart and deferential young gentleman, who came[SEP]up to my bedside, bowing again and again, and informed me that he was[SEP]of the household of the Princess Flavia, and that her Royal Highness[SEP]had sent him especially to enquire how the King’s health was after the[SEP]fatigues which his Majesty had undergone yesterday.[EOT]
[SOT]“My best thanks, sir, to my cousin,” said I; “and tell her Royal[SEP]Highness that I was never better in my life.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The King,” added old Sapt (who, I began to find, loved a good lie for[SEP]its own sake), “has slept without a break all night.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The young gentleman (he reminded me of “Osric” in Hamlet) bowed himself[SEP]out again.[SEP]The farce was over, and Fritz von Tarlenheim’s pale face[SEP]recalled us to reality--though, in faith, the farce had to be reality[SEP]for us now.[EOT]
[SOT]“Is the King dead?[SEP]” he whispered.[EOT]
[SOT]“Please God, no,” said I.[SEP]“But he’s in the hands of Black Michael![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]A Fair Cousin and a Dark Brother[EOT]
[SOT]A real king’s life is perhaps a hard one; but a pretended king’s is,[SEP]I warrant, much harder.[SEP]On the next day, Sapt instructed me in my[SEP]duties--what I ought to do and what I ought to know--for three hours;[SEP]then I snatched breakfast, with Sapt still opposite me, telling me that[SEP]the King always took white wine in the morning and was known to detest[SEP]all highly seasoned dishes.[SEP]Then came the Chancellor, for another three[SEP]hours; and to him I had to explain that the hurt to my finger (we turned[SEP]that bullet to happy account) prevented me from writing--whence arose[SEP]great to-do, hunting of precedents and so forth, ending in my “making[SEP]my mark,” and the Chancellor attesting it with a superfluity of solemn[SEP]oaths.[SEP]Then the French ambassador was introduced, to present his[SEP]credentials; here my ignorance was of no importance, as the King would[SEP]have been equally raw to the business (we worked through the whole _corps[SEP]diplomatique_ in the next few days, a demise of the Crown necessitating[SEP]all this bother).[EOT]
[SOT]Then, at last, I was left alone.[SEP]I called my new servant (we had chosen,[SEP]to succeed poor Josef, a young man who had never known the King), had a[SEP]brandy-and-soda brought to me, and observed to Sapt that I trusted that[SEP]I might now have a rest.[SEP]Fritz von Tarlenheim was standing by.[EOT]
[SOT]“By heaven![SEP]” he cried, “we waste time.[SEP]Aren’t we going to throw Black[SEP]Michael by the heels?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Gently, my son, gently,” said Sapt, knitting his brows.[SEP]“It would be[SEP]a pleasure, but it might cost us dear.[SEP]Would Michael fall and leave the[SEP]King alive?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And,” I suggested, “while the King is here in Strelsau, on his throne,[SEP]what grievance has he against his dear brother Michael?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Are we to do nothing, then?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“We’re to do nothing stupid,” growled Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“In fact, Fritz,” said I, “I am reminded of a situation in one of our[SEP]English plays--The Critic--have you heard of it?[SEP]Or, if you like, of two[SEP]men, each covering the other with a revolver.[SEP]For I can’t expose Michael[SEP]without exposing myself--”[EOT]
[SOT]“And the King,” put in Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“And, hang me if Michael won’t expose himself, if he tries to expose[SEP]me![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s very pretty,” said old Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“If I’m found out,” I pursued, “I will make a clean breast of it, and[SEP]fight it out with the duke; but at present I’m waiting for a move from[SEP]him.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He’ll kill the King,” said Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]“Not he,” said Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“Half of the Six are in Strelsau,” said Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]“Only half?[SEP]You’re sure?[SEP]” asked Sapt eagerly.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes--only half.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Then the King’s alive, for the other three are guarding him![SEP]” cried[SEP]Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes--you’re right![SEP]” exclaimed Fritz, his face brightening.[SEP]“If the[SEP]King were dead and buried, they’d all be here with Michael.[SEP]You know[SEP]Michael’s back, colonel?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I know, curse him![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” said I, “who are the Six?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I think you’ll make their acquaintance soon,” said Sapt.[SEP]“They are six[SEP]gentlemen whom Michael maintains in his household: they belong to him[SEP]body and soul.[SEP]There are three Ruritanians; then there’s a Frenchman, a[SEP]Belgian, and one of your countrymen.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“They’d all cut a throat if Michael told them,” said Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]“Perhaps they’ll cut mine,” I suggested.[EOT]
[SOT]“Nothing more likely,” agreed Sapt.[SEP]“Who are here, Fritz?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“De Gautet, Bersonin, and Detchard.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The foreigners![SEP]It’s as plain as a pikestaff.[SEP]He’s brought them, and[SEP]left the Ruritanians with the King; that’s because he wants to commit[SEP]the Ruritanians as deep as he can.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“They were none of them among our friends at the lodge, then?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“I wish they had been,” said Sapt wistfully.[SEP]“They had been, not six,[SEP]but four, by now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I had already developed one attribute of royalty--a feeling that I need[SEP]not reveal all my mind or my secret designs even to my intimate friends.[SEP]I had fully resolved on my course of action.[SEP]I meant to make myself[SEP]as popular as I could, and at the same time to show no disfavour to[SEP]Michael.[SEP]By these means I hoped to allay the hostility of his adherents,[SEP]and make it appear, if an open conflict came about, that he was[SEP]ungrateful and not oppressed.[EOT]
[SOT]Yet an open conflict was not what I hoped for.[EOT]
[SOT]The King’s interest demanded secrecy; and while secrecy lasted, I had[SEP]a fine game to play in Strelsau, Michael should not grow stronger for[SEP]delay![EOT]
[SOT]I ordered my horse, and, attended by Fritz von Tarlenheim, rode in the[SEP]grand new avenue of the Royal Park, returning all the salutes which I[SEP]received with punctilious politeness.[SEP]Then I rode through a few of the[SEP]streets, stopped and bought flowers of a pretty girl, paying her with[SEP]a piece of gold; and then, having attracted the desired amount of[SEP]attention (for I had a trail of half a thousand people after me), I rode[SEP]to the residence of the Princess Flavia, and asked if she would[SEP]receive me.[SEP]This step created much interest, and was met with shouts of[SEP]approval.[SEP]The princess was very popular, and the Chancellor himself had[SEP]not scrupled to hint to me that the more I pressed my suit, and the more[SEP]rapidly I brought it to a prosperous conclusion, the stronger should I[SEP]be in the affection of my subjects.[SEP]The Chancellor, of course, did not[SEP]understand the difficulties which lay in the way of following his loyal[SEP]and excellent advice.[SEP]However, I thought I could do no harm by calling;[SEP]and in this view Fritz supported me with a cordiality that surprised me,[SEP]until he confessed that he also had his motives for liking a visit to[SEP]the princess’s house, which motive was no other than a great desire to[SEP]see the princess’s lady-in-waiting and bosom friend, the Countess Helga[SEP]von Strofzin.[EOT]
[SOT]Etiquette seconded Fritz’s hopes.[SEP]While I was ushered into the[SEP]princess’s room, he remained with the countess in the ante-chamber: in[SEP]spite of the people and servants who were hanging about, I doubt not[SEP]that they managed a _tête-à-tête;_ but I had no leisure to think of them,[SEP]for I was playing the most delicate move in all my difficult game.[SEP]I had[SEP]to keep the princess devoted to me--and yet indifferent to me: I had to[SEP]show affection for her--and not feel it.[SEP]I had to make love for another,[SEP]and that to a girl who--princess or no princess--was the most beautiful[SEP]I had ever seen.[SEP]Well, I braced myself to the task, made no easier by[SEP]the charming embarrassment with which I was received.[SEP]How I succeeded in[SEP]carrying out my programme will appear hereafter.[EOT]
[SOT]“You are gaining golden laurels,” she said.[SEP]“You are like the prince in[SEP]Shakespeare who was transformed by becoming king.[SEP]But I’m forgetting you[SEP]are King, sire.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I ask you to speak nothing but what your heart tells you--and to call[SEP]me nothing but my name.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She looked at me for a moment.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then I’m glad and proud, Rudolf,” said she.[SEP]“Why, as I told you, your[SEP]very face is changed.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I acknowledged the compliment, but I disliked the topic; so I said:[EOT]
[SOT]“My brother is back, I hear.[SEP]He made an excursion, didn’t he?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, he is here,” she said, frowning a little.[EOT]
[SOT]“He can’t stay long from Strelsau, it seems,” I observed, smiling.[SEP]“Well, we are all glad to see him.[SEP]The nearer he is, the better.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The princess glanced at me with a gleam of amusement in her eyes.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why, cousin?[SEP]Is it that you can--?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“See better what he’s doing?[SEP]Perhaps,” said I.[SEP]“And why are you glad?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I didn’t say I was glad,” she answered.[EOT]
[SOT]“Some people say so for you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“There are many insolent people,” she said, with delightful haughtiness.[EOT]
[SOT]“Possibly you mean that I am one?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Your Majesty could not be,” she said, curtseying in feigned deference,[SEP]but adding, mischievously, after a pause: “Unless, that is--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, unless what?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Unless you tell me that I mind a snap of my fingers where the Duke of[SEP]Strelsau is.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Really, I wished that I had been the King.[EOT]
[SOT]“You don’t care where cousin Michael--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah, cousin Michael![SEP]I call him the Duke of Strelsau.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You call him Michael when you meet him?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes--by the orders of your father.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I see.[SEP]And now by mine?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“If those are your orders.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, decidedly![SEP]We must all be pleasant to our dear Michael.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You order me to receive his friends, too, I suppose?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The Six?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You call them that, too?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“To be in the fashion, I do.[SEP]But I order you to receive no one unless[SEP]you like.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Except yourself?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I pray for myself.[SEP]I could not order.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]As I spoke, there came a cheer from the street.[SEP]The princess ran to the[SEP]window.[EOT]
[SOT]“It is he![SEP]” she cried.[SEP]“It is--the Duke of Strelsau![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I smiled, but said nothing.[SEP]She returned to her seat.[SEP]For a few moments[SEP]we sat in silence.[SEP]The noise outside subsided, but I heard the tread of[SEP]feet in the ante-room.[SEP]I began to talk on general subjects.[SEP]This went on[SEP]for some minutes.[SEP]I wondered what had become of Michael, but it did[SEP]not seem to be for me to interfere.[SEP]All at once, to my great surprise,[SEP]Flavia, clasping her hands asked in an agitated voice:[EOT]
[SOT]“Are you wise to make him angry?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What?[SEP]Who?[SEP]How am I making him angry?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why, by keeping him waiting.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“My dear cousin, I don’t want to keep him--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, then, is he to come in?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course, if you wish it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She looked at me curiously.[EOT]
[SOT]“How funny you are,” she said.[SEP]“Of course no one could be announced[SEP]while I was with you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Here was a charming attribute of royalty![EOT]
[SOT]“An excellent etiquette![SEP]” I cried.[SEP]“But I had clean forgotten it; and if[SEP]I were alone with someone else, couldn’t you be announced?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You know as well as I do.[SEP]I could be, because I am of the Blood;” and[SEP]she still looked puzzled.[EOT]
[SOT]“I never could remember all these silly rules,” said I, rather feebly,[SEP]as I inwardly cursed Fritz for not posting me up.[SEP]“But I’ll repair my[SEP]fault.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I jumped up, flung open the door, and advanced into the ante-room.[SEP]Michael was sitting at a table, a heavy frown on his face.[SEP]Everyone[SEP]else was standing, save that impudent young dog Fritz, who was lounging[SEP]easily in an armchair, and flirting with the Countess Helga.[SEP]He leapt up[SEP]as I entered, with a deferential alacrity that lent point to his former[SEP]nonchalance.[SEP]I had no difficulty in understanding that the duke might[SEP]not like young Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]I held out my hand, Michael took it, and I embraced him.[SEP]Then I drew him[SEP]with me into the inner room.[EOT]
[SOT]“Brother,” I said, “if I had known you were here, you should not have[SEP]waited a moment before I asked the princess to permit me to bring you to[SEP]her.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He thanked me, but coldly.[SEP]The man had many qualities, but he could not[SEP]hide his feelings.[SEP]A mere stranger could have seen that he hated me, and[SEP]hated worse to see me with Princess Flavia; yet I am persuaded that he[SEP]tried to conceal both feelings, and, further, that he tried to persuade[SEP]me that he believed I was verily the King.[SEP]I did not know, of course;[SEP]but, unless the King were an impostor, at once cleverer and more[SEP]audacious than I (and I began to think something of myself in that[SEP]role), Michael could not believe that.[SEP]And, if he didn’t, how he must[SEP]have loathed paying me deference, and hearing my “Michael” and my[SEP]“Flavia![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Your hand is hurt, sire,” he observed, with concern.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, I was playing a game with a mongrel dog” (I meant to stir him),[SEP]“and you know, brother, such have uncertain tempers.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He smiled sourly, and his dark eyes rested on me for a moment.[EOT]
[SOT]“But is there no danger from the bite?[SEP]” cried Flavia anxiously.[EOT]
[SOT]“None from this,” said I.[SEP]“If I gave him a chance to bite deeper, it[SEP]would be different, cousin.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But surely he has been destroyed?[SEP]” said she.[EOT]
[SOT]“Not yet.[SEP]We’re waiting to see if his bite is harmful.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And if it is?[SEP]” asked Michael, with his sour smile.[EOT]
[SOT]“He’ll be knocked on the head, brother,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“You won’t play with him any more?[SEP]” urged Flavia.[EOT]
[SOT]“Perhaps I shall.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He might bite again.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Doubtless he’ll try,” said I, smiling.[EOT]
[SOT]Then, fearing Michael would say something which I must appear to[SEP]resent (for, though I might show him my hate, I must seem to be full of[SEP]favour), I began to compliment him on the magnificent condition of his[SEP]regiment, and of their loyal greeting to me on the day of my coronation.[SEP]Thence I passed to a rapturous description of the hunting-lodge which[SEP]he had lent me.[SEP]But he rose suddenly to his feet.[SEP]His temper was failing[SEP]him, and, with an excuse, he said farewell.[SEP]However, as he reached the[SEP]door he stopped, saying:[EOT]
[SOT]“Three friends of mine are very anxious to have the honour of being[SEP]presented to you, sire.[SEP]They are here in the ante-chamber.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I joined him directly, passing my arm through his.[SEP]The look on his[SEP]face was honey to me.[SEP]We entered the ante-chamber in fraternal fashion.[SEP]Michael beckoned, and three men came forward.[EOT]
[SOT]“These gentlemen,” said Michael, with a stately courtesy which, to[SEP]do him justice, he could assume with perfect grace and ease, “are the[SEP]loyalest and most devoted of your Majesty’s servants, and are my very[SEP]faithful and attached friends.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“On the last ground as much as the first,” said I, “I am very pleased to[SEP]see them.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]They came one by one and kissed my hand--De Gautet, a tall lean fellow,[SEP]with hair standing straight up and waxed moustache; Bersonin, the[SEP]Belgian, a portly man of middle height with a bald head (though he was[SEP]not far past thirty); and last, the Englishman, Detchard, a narrow-faced[SEP]fellow, with close-cut fair hair and a bronzed complexion.[SEP]He was a[SEP]finely made man, broad in the shoulder and slender in the hips.[SEP]A good[SEP]fighter, but a crooked customer, I put him down for.[SEP]I spoke to him in[SEP]English, with a slight foreign accent, and I swear the fellow smiled,[SEP]though he hid the smile in an instant.[EOT]
[SOT]“So Mr. Detchard is in the secret,” thought I.[EOT]
[SOT]Having got rid of my dear brother and his friends, I returned to make my[SEP]adieu to my cousin.[SEP]She was standing at the door.[SEP]I bade her farewell,[SEP]taking her hand in mine.[EOT]
[SOT]“Rudolf,” she said, very low, “be careful, won’t you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Of what?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You know--I can’t say.[SEP]But think what your life is to--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well to--?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“To Ruritania.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Was I right to play the part, or wrong to play the part?[SEP]I know not:[SEP]evil lay both ways, and I dared not tell her the truth.[EOT]
[SOT]“Only to Ruritania?[SEP]” I asked softly.[EOT]
[SOT]A sudden flush spread over her incomparable face.[EOT]
[SOT]“To your friends, too,” she said.[EOT]
[SOT]“Friends?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And to your cousin,” she whispered, “and loving servant.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I could not speak.[SEP]I kissed her hand, and went out cursing myself.[EOT]
[SOT]Outside I found Master Fritz, quite reckless of the footmen, playing at[SEP]cat’s-cradle with the Countess Helga.[EOT]
[SOT]“Hang it![SEP]” said he, “we can’t always be plotting.[SEP]Love claims his[SEP]share.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m inclined to think he does,” said I; and Fritz, who had been by my[SEP]side, dropped respectfully behind.[EOT]
[SOT]A New Use for a Tea-table[EOT]
[SOT]If I were to detail the ordinary events of my daily life at this time,[SEP]they might prove instructive to people who are not familiar with the[SEP]inside of palaces; if I revealed some of the secrets I learnt, they[SEP]might prove of interest to the statesmen of Europe.[SEP]I intend to do[SEP]neither of these things.[SEP]I should be between the Scylla of dullness and[SEP]the Charybdis of indiscretion, and I feel that I had far better confine[SEP]myself strictly to the underground drama which was being played beneath[SEP]the surface of Ruritanian politics.[SEP]I need only say that the secret of[SEP]my imposture defied detection.[SEP]I made mistakes.[SEP]I had bad minutes: it[SEP]needed all the tact and graciousness whereof I was master to smooth over[SEP]some apparent lapses of memory and unmindfulness of old acquaintances of[SEP]which I was guilty.[SEP]But I escaped, and I attribute my escape, as I have[SEP]said before, most of all, to the very audacity of the enterprise.[SEP]It is[SEP]my belief that, given the necessary physical likeness, it was far easier[SEP]to pretend to be King of Ruritania than it would have been to personate[SEP]my next-door neighbour.[SEP]One day Sapt came into my room.[SEP]He threw me a[SEP]letter, saying:[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s for you--a woman’s hand, I think.[SEP]But I’ve some news for you[SEP]first.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What’s that?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The King’s at the Castle of Zenda,” said he.[EOT]
[SOT]“How do you know?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Because the other half of Michael’s Six are there.[SEP]I had enquiries[SEP]made, and they’re all there--Lauengram, Krafstein, and young Rupert[SEP]Hentzau: three rogues, too, on my honour, as fine as live in Ruritania.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, Fritz wants you to march to the Castle with horse, foot, and[SEP]artillery.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And drag the moat?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“That would be about it,” grinned Sapt, “and we shouldn’t find the[SEP]King’s body then.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You think it’s certain he’s there?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Very probable.[SEP]Besides the fact of those three being there, the[SEP]drawbridge is kept up, and no one goes in without an order from young[SEP]Hentzau or Black Michael himself.[SEP]We must tie Fritz up.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ll go to Zenda,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“You’re mad.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Some day.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, perhaps.[SEP]You’ll very likely stay there though, if you do.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That may be, my friend,” said I carelessly.[EOT]
[SOT]“His Majesty looks sulky,” observed Sapt.[SEP]“How’s the love affair?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Damn you, hold your tongue![SEP]” I said.[EOT]
[SOT]He looked at me for a moment, then he lit his pipe.[SEP]It was quite true[SEP]that I was in a bad temper, and I went on perversely:[EOT]
[SOT]“Wherever I go, I’m dogged by half a dozen fellows.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I know you are; I send ’em,” he replied composedly.[EOT]
[SOT]“What for?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well,” said Sapt, puffing away, “it wouldn’t be exactly inconvenient[SEP]for Black Michael if you disappeared.[SEP]With you gone, the old game that[SEP]we stopped would be played--or he’d have a shot at it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I can take care of myself.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“De Gautet, Bersonin, and Detchard are in Strelsau; and any one of[SEP]them, lad, would cut your throat as readily--as readily as I would Black[SEP]Michael’s, and a deal more treacherously.[SEP]What’s the letter?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I opened it and read it aloud:[EOT]
[SOT]“If the King desires to know what it deeply concerns the King to know,[SEP]let him do as this letter bids him.[SEP]At the end of the New Avenue there[SEP]stands a house in large grounds.[SEP]The house has a portico, with a statue[SEP]of a nymph on it.[SEP]A wall encloses the garden; there is a gate in the[SEP]wall at the back.[SEP]At twelve o’clock tonight, if the King enters alone[SEP]by that gate, turns to the right, and walks twenty yards, he will find[SEP]a summerhouse, approached by a flight of six steps.[SEP]If he mounts and[SEP]enters, he will find someone who will tell him what touches most dearly[SEP]his life and his throne.[SEP]This is written by a faithful friend.[SEP]He must[SEP]be alone.[SEP]If he neglects the invitation his life will be in danger.[SEP]Let[SEP]him show this to no one, or he will ruin a woman who loves him: Black[SEP]Michael does not pardon.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No,” observed Sapt, as I ended, “but he can dictate a very pretty[SEP]letter.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I had arrived at the same conclusion, and was about to throw the letter[SEP]away, when I saw there was more writing on the other side.[EOT]
[SOT]“Hallo![SEP]there’s some more.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“If you hesitate,” the writer continued, “consult Colonel Sapt--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Eh,” exclaimed that gentleman, genuinely astonished.[SEP]“Does she take me[SEP]for a greater fool than you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I waved to him to be silent.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ask him what woman would do most to prevent the duke from marrying his[SEP]cousin, and therefore most to prevent him becoming king?[SEP]And ask if her[SEP]name begins with--A?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I sprang to my feet.[SEP]Sapt laid down his pipe.[EOT]
[SOT]“Antoinette de Mauban, by heaven![SEP]” I cried.[EOT]
[SOT]“How do you know?[SEP]” asked Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]I told him what I knew of the lady, and how I knew it.[SEP]He nodded.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s so far true that she’s had a great row with Michael,” said he,[SEP]thoughtfully.[EOT]
[SOT]“If she would, she could be useful,” I said.[EOT]
[SOT]“I believe, though, that Michael wrote that letter.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“So do I, but I mean to know for certain.[SEP]I shall go, Sapt.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No, I shall go,” said he.[EOT]
[SOT]“You may go as far as the gate.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I shall go to the summer-house.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m hanged if you shall![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I rose and leant my back against the mantelpiece.[EOT]
[SOT]“Sapt, I believe in that woman, and I shall go.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t believe in any woman,” said Sapt, “and you shan’t go.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I either go to the summer-house or back to England,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt began to know exactly how far he could lead or drive, and when he[SEP]must follow.[EOT]
[SOT]“We’re playing against time,” I added.[SEP]“Every day we leave the King[SEP]where he is there is fresh risk.[SEP]Every day I masquerade like this, there[SEP]is fresh risk.[SEP]Sapt, we must play high; we must force the game.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“So be it,” he said, with a sigh.[EOT]
[SOT]To cut the story short, at half-past eleven that night Sapt and I[SEP]mounted our horses.[SEP]Fritz was again left on guard, our destination not[SEP]being revealed to him.[SEP]It was a very dark night.[SEP]I wore no sword, but I[SEP]carried a revolver, a long knife, and a bull’s-eye lantern.[SEP]We arrived[SEP]outside the gate.[SEP]I dismounted.[SEP]Sapt held out his hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“I shall wait here,” he said.[SEP]“If I hear a shot, I’ll--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Stay where you are; it’s the King’s only chance.[SEP]You mustn’t come to[SEP]grief too.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You’re right, lad.[SEP]Good luck![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I pressed the little gate.[SEP]It yielded, and I found myself in a wild sort[SEP]of shrubbery.[SEP]There was a grass-grown path and, turning to the right as[SEP]I had been bidden, I followed it cautiously.[SEP]My lantern was closed, the[SEP]revolver was in my hand.[SEP]I heard not a sound.[SEP]Presently a large dark[SEP]object loomed out of the gloom ahead of me.[SEP]It was the summer-house.[SEP]Reaching the steps, I mounted them and found myself confronted by a[SEP]weak, rickety wooden door, which hung upon the latch.[SEP]I pushed it open[SEP]and walked in.[SEP]A woman flew to me and seized my hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“Shut the door,” she whispered.[EOT]
[SOT]I obeyed and turned the light of my lantern on her.[SEP]She was in evening[SEP]dress, arrayed very sumptuously, and her dark striking beauty was[SEP]marvellously displayed in the glare of the bull’s-eye.[SEP]The summer-house[SEP]was a bare little room, furnished only with a couple of chairs and a[SEP]small iron table, such as one sees in a tea garden or an open-air cafe.[EOT]
[SOT]“Don’t talk,” she said.[SEP]“We’ve no time.[SEP]Listen![SEP]I know you, Mr.[SEP]Rassendyll.[SEP]I wrote that letter at the duke’s orders.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“So I thought,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“In twenty minutes three men will be here to kill you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Three--the three?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes.[SEP]You must be gone by then.[SEP]If not, tonight you’ll be killed--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Or they will.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Listen, listen![SEP]When you’re killed, your body will be taken to a low[SEP]quarter of the town.[SEP]It will be found there.[SEP]Michael will at once[SEP]arrest all your friends--Colonel Sapt and Captain von Tarlenheim[SEP]first--proclaim a state of siege in Strelsau, and send a messenger to[SEP]Zenda.[SEP]The other three will murder the King in the Castle, and the duke[SEP]will proclaim either himself or the princess--himself, if he is strong[SEP]enough.[SEP]Anyhow, he’ll marry her, and become king in fact, and soon in[SEP]name.[SEP]Do you see?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s a pretty plot.[SEP]But why, madame, do you--?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Say I’m a Christian--or say I’m jealous.[SEP]My God![SEP]shall I see him marry[SEP]her?[SEP]Now go; but remember--this is what I have to tell you--that never,[SEP]by night or by day, are you safe.[SEP]Three men follow you as a guard.[SEP]Is it[SEP]not so?[SEP]Well, three follow them; Michael’s three are never two hundred[SEP]yards from you.[SEP]Your life is not worth a moment if ever they find you[SEP]alone.[SEP]Now go.[SEP]Stay, the gate will be guarded by now.[SEP]Go down softly, go[SEP]past the summer-house, on for a hundred yards, and you’ll find a ladder[SEP]against the wall.[SEP]Get over it, and fly for your life.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And you?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“I have my game to play too.[SEP]If he finds out what I have done, we shall[SEP]not meet again.[SEP]If not, I may yet--But never mind.[SEP]Go at once.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But what will you tell him?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That you never came--that you saw through the trick.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I took her hand and kissed it.[EOT]
[SOT]“Madame,” said I, “you have served the King well tonight.[SEP]Where is he in[SEP]the Castle?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She sank her voice to a fearful whisper.[SEP]I listened eagerly.[EOT]
[SOT]“Across the drawbridge you come to a heavy door; behind that lies--Hark![SEP]What’s that?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]There were steps outside.[EOT]
[SOT]“They’re coming![SEP]They’re too soon![SEP]Heavens![SEP]they’re too soon![SEP]” and she[SEP]turned pale as death.[EOT]
[SOT]“They seem to me,” said I, “to be in the nick of time.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Close your lantern.[SEP]See, there’s a chink in the door.[SEP]Can you see[SEP]them?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I put my eye to the chink.[SEP]On the lowest step I saw three dim figures.[SEP]I[SEP]cocked my revolver.[SEP]Antoinette hastily laid her hand on mine.[EOT]
[SOT]“You may kill one,” said she.[SEP]“But what then?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]A voice came from outside--a voice that spoke perfect English.[EOT]
[SOT]“Mr. Rassendyll,” it said.[EOT]
[SOT]I made no answer.[EOT]
[SOT]“We want to talk to you.[SEP]Will you promise not to shoot till we’ve done?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Detchard?[SEP]” I said.[EOT]
[SOT]“Never mind names.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Then let mine alone.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“All right, sire.[SEP]I’ve an offer for you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I still had my eye to the chink.[SEP]The three had mounted two steps more;[SEP]three revolvers pointed full at the door.[EOT]
[SOT]“Will you let us in?[SEP]We pledge our honour to observe the truce.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Don’t trust them,” whispered Antoinette.[EOT]
[SOT]“We can speak through the door,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“But you might open it and fire,” objected Detchard; “and though we[SEP]should finish you, you might finish one of us.[SEP]Will you give your honour[SEP]not to fire while we talk?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Don’t trust them,” whispered Antoinette again.[EOT]
[SOT]A sudden idea struck me.[SEP]I considered it for a moment.[SEP]It seemed[SEP]feasible.[EOT]
[SOT]“I give my honour not to fire before you do,” said I; “but I won’t let[SEP]you in.[SEP]Stand outside and talk.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s sensible,” he said.[EOT]
[SOT]The three mounted the last step, and stood just outside the door.[SEP]I[SEP]laid my ear to the chink.[SEP]I could hear no words, but Detchard’s head was[SEP]close to that of the taller of his companions (De Gautet, I guessed).[EOT]
[SOT]“H’m![SEP]Private communications,” thought I.[SEP]Then I said aloud:[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, gentlemen, what’s the offer?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“A safe-conduct to the frontier, and fifty thousand pounds English.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No, no,” whispered Antoinette in the lowest of whispers.[SEP]“They are[SEP]treacherous.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That seems handsome,” said I, reconnoitering through the chink.[SEP]They[SEP]were all close together, just outside the door now.[EOT]
[SOT]I had probed the hearts of the ruffians, and I did not need Antoinette’s[SEP]warning.[SEP]They meant to “rush” me as soon as I was engaged in talk.[EOT]
[SOT]“Give me a minute to consider,” said I; and I thought I heard a laugh[SEP]outside.[EOT]
[SOT]I turned to Antoinette.[EOT]
[SOT]“Stand up close to the wall, out of the line of fire from the door,” I[SEP]whispered.[EOT]
[SOT]“What are you going to do?[SEP]” she asked in fright.[EOT]
[SOT]“You’ll see,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]I took up the little iron table.[SEP]It was not very heavy for a man of my[SEP]strength, and I held it by the legs.[SEP]The top, protruding in front of[SEP]me, made a complete screen for my head and body.[SEP]I fastened my closed[SEP]lantern to my belt and put my revolver in a handy pocket.[SEP]Suddenly I saw[SEP]the door move ever so slightly--perhaps it was the wind, perhaps it was[SEP]a hand trying it outside.[EOT]
[SOT]I drew back as far as I could from the door, holding the table in the[SEP]position that I have described.[SEP]Then I called out:[EOT]
[SOT]“Gentlemen, I accept your offer, relying on your honour.[SEP]If you will[SEP]open the door--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Open it yourself,” said Detchard.[EOT]
[SOT]“It opens outwards,” said I.[SEP]“Stand back a little, gentlemen, or I shall[SEP]hit you when I open it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I went and fumbled with the latch.[SEP]Then I stole back to my place on[SEP]tiptoe.[EOT]
[SOT]“I can’t open it![SEP]” I cried.[SEP]“The latch has caught.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Tut![SEP]I’ll open it![SEP]” cried Detchard.[SEP]“Nonsense, Bersonin, why not?[SEP]Are[SEP]you afraid of one man?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I smiled to myself.[SEP]An instant later the door was flung back.[SEP]The gleam[SEP]of a lantern showed me the three close together outside, their[SEP]revolvers levelled.[SEP]With a shout, I charged at my utmost pace across the[SEP]summer-house and through the doorway.[SEP]Three shots rang out and battered[SEP]into my shield.[SEP]Another moment, and I leapt out and the table caught[SEP]them full and square, and in a tumbling, swearing, struggling mass, they[SEP]and I and that brave table, rolled down the steps of the summerhouse to[SEP]the ground below.[SEP]Antoinette de Mauban shrieked, but I rose to my feet,[SEP]laughing aloud.[EOT]
[SOT]De Gautet and Bersonin lay like men stunned.[SEP]Detchard was under the[SEP]table, but, as I rose, he pushed it from him and fired again.[SEP]I raised[SEP]my revolver and took a snap shot; I heard him curse, and then I ran like[SEP]a hare, laughing as I went, past the summer-house and along by the wall.[SEP]I heard steps behind me, and turning round I fired again for luck.[SEP]The[SEP]steps ceased.[EOT]
[SOT]“Please God,” said I, “she told me the truth about the ladder![SEP]” for the[SEP]wall was high and topped with iron spikes.[EOT]
[SOT]Yes, there it was.[SEP]I was up and over in a minute.[SEP]Doubling back, I saw[SEP]the horses; then I heard a shot.[SEP]It was Sapt.[SEP]He had heard us, and was[SEP]battling and raging with the locked gate, hammering it and firing into[SEP]the keyhole like a man possessed.[SEP]He had quite forgotten that he was[SEP]not to take part in the fight.[SEP]Whereat I laughed again, and said, as I[SEP]clapped him on the shoulder:[EOT]
[SOT]“Come home to bed, old chap.[SEP]I’ve got the finest tea-table story that[SEP]ever you heard![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He started and cried: “You’re safe![SEP]” and wrung my hand.[SEP]But a moment[SEP]later he added:[EOT]
[SOT]“And what the devil are you laughing at?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Four gentlemen round a tea-table,” said I, laughing still, for it had[SEP]been uncommonly ludicrous to see the formidable three altogether routed[SEP]and scattered with no more deadly weapon than an ordinary tea-table.[EOT]
[SOT]Moreover, you will observe that I had honourably kept my word, and not[SEP]fired till they did.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER 10[EOT]
[SOT]A Great Chance for a Villain[EOT]
[SOT]It was the custom that the Prefect of Police should send every afternoon[SEP]a report to me on the condition of the capital and the feeling of the[SEP]people: the document included also an account of the movements of any[SEP]persons whom the police had received instructions to watch.[SEP]Since I had[SEP]been in Strelsau, Sapt had been in the habit of reading the report and[SEP]telling me any items of interest which it might contain.[SEP]On the day[SEP]after my adventure in the summer-house, he came in as I was playing a[SEP]hand of _écarté_ with Fritz von Tarlenheim.[EOT]
[SOT]“The report is rather full of interest this afternoon,” he observed,[SEP]sitting down.[EOT]
[SOT]“Do you find,” I asked, “any mention of a certain fracas?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He shook his head with a smile.[EOT]
[SOT]“I find this first,” he said: “‘His Highness the Duke of Strelsau left[SEP]the city (so far as it appears, suddenly), accompanied by several of his[SEP]household.[SEP]His destination is believed to be the Castle of Zenda, but[SEP]the party travelled by road and not by train.[SEP]MM De Gautet, Bersonin,[SEP]and Detchard followed an hour later, the last-named carrying his arm in[SEP]a sling.[SEP]The cause of his wound is not known, but it is suspected that[SEP]he has fought a duel, probably incidental to a love affair.[SEP]’”[EOT]
[SOT]“That is remotely true,” I observed, very well pleased to find that I[SEP]had left my mark on the fellow.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then we come to this,” pursued Sapt: “‘Madame de Mauban, whose[SEP]movements have been watched according to instructions, left by train at[SEP]midday.[SEP]She took a ticket for Dresden--’”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s an old habit of hers,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“‘The Dresden train stops at Zenda.[SEP]’ An acute fellow, this.[SEP]And finally[SEP]listen to this: ‘The state of feeling in the city is not satisfactory.[SEP]The King is much criticized’ (you know, he’s told to be quite frank)[SEP]‘for taking no steps about his marriage.[SEP]From enquiries among the[SEP]entourage of the Princess Flavia, her Royal Highness is believed to be[SEP]deeply offended by the remissness of his Majesty.[SEP]The common people are[SEP]coupling her name with that of the Duke of Strelsau, and the duke gains[SEP]much popularity from the suggestion.[SEP]’ I have caused the announcement that[SEP]the King gives a ball tonight in honour of the princess to be widely[SEP]diffused, and the effect is good.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“That is news to me,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, the preparations are all made![SEP]” laughed Fritz.[SEP]“I’ve seen to that.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt turned to me and said, in a sharp, decisive voice:[EOT]
[SOT]“You must make love to her tonight, you know.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I think it is very likely I shall, if I see her alone,” said I.[SEP]“Hang[SEP]it, Sapt, you don’t suppose I find it difficult?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Fritz whistled a bar or two; then he said: “You’ll find it only too[SEP]easy.[SEP]Look here, I hate telling you this, but I must.[SEP]The Countess Helga[SEP]told me that the princess had become most attached to the King.[SEP]Since[SEP]the coronation, her feelings have undergone a marked development.[SEP]It’s[SEP]quite true that she is deeply wounded by the King’s apparent neglect.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Here’s a kettle of fish![SEP]” I groaned.[EOT]
[SOT]“Tut, tut![SEP]” said Sapt.[SEP]“I suppose you’ve made pretty speeches to a girl[SEP]before now?[SEP]That’s all she wants.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Fritz, himself a lover, understood better my distress.[SEP]He laid his hand[SEP]on my shoulder, but said nothing.[EOT]
[SOT]“I think, though,” pursued that cold-blooded old Sapt, “that you’d[SEP]better make your offer tonight.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Good heavens![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Or, any rate, go near it: and I shall send a ‘semi-official’ to the[SEP]papers.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ll do nothing of the sort--no more will you![SEP]” said I.[SEP]“I utterly[SEP]refuse to take part in making a fool of the princess.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt looked at me with his small keen eyes.[SEP]A slow cunning smile passed[SEP]over his face.[EOT]
[SOT]“All right, lad, all right,” said he.[SEP]“We mustn’t press you too hard.[SEP]Soothe her down a bit, if you can, you know.[SEP]Now for Michael![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, damn Michael![SEP]” said I.[SEP]“He’ll do tomorrow.[SEP]Here, Fritz, come for a[SEP]stroll in the garden.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt at once yielded.[SEP]His rough manner covered a wonderful tact--and[SEP]as I came to recognize more and more, a remarkable knowledge of human[SEP]nature.[SEP]Why did he urge me so little about the princess?[SEP]Because he[SEP]knew that her beauty and my ardour would carry me further than all his[SEP]arguments--and that the less I thought about the thing, the more likely[SEP]was I to do it.[SEP]He must have seen the unhappiness he might bring on the[SEP]princess; but that went for nothing with him.[SEP]Can I say, confidently,[SEP]that he was wrong?[SEP]If the King were restored, the princess must turn to[SEP]him, either knowing or not knowing the change.[SEP]And if the King were not[SEP]restored to us?[SEP]It was a subject that we had never yet spoken of.[SEP]But I[SEP]had an idea that, in such a case, Sapt meant to seat me on the throne of[SEP]Ruritania for the term of my life.[SEP]He would have set Satan himself there[SEP]sooner than that pupil of his, Black Michael.[EOT]
[SOT]The ball was a sumptuous affair.[SEP]I opened it by dancing a quadrille[SEP]with Flavia: then I waltzed with her.[SEP]Curious eyes and eager whispers[SEP]attended us.[SEP]We went in to supper; and, half way through, I, half mad by[SEP]then, for her glance had answered mine, and her quick breathing met my[SEP]stammered sentences--I rose in my place before all the brilliant crowd,[SEP]and taking the Red Rose that I wore, flung the ribbon with its jewelled[SEP]badge round her neck.[SEP]In a tumult of applause I sat down: I saw Sapt[SEP]smiling over his wine, and Fritz frowning.[SEP]The rest of the meal passed[SEP]in silence; neither Flavia nor I could speak.[SEP]Fritz touched me on the[SEP]shoulder, and I rose, gave her my arm, and walked down the hall into a[SEP]little room, where coffee was served to us.[SEP]The gentlemen and ladies in[SEP]attendance withdrew, and we were alone.[EOT]
[SOT]The little room had French windows opening on the gardens.[SEP]The night was[SEP]fine, cool, and fragrant.[SEP]Flavia sat down, and I stood opposite her.[SEP]I[SEP]was struggling with myself: if she had not looked at me, I believe that[SEP]even then I should have won my fight.[SEP]But suddenly, involuntarily, she[SEP]gave me one brief glance--a glance of question, hurriedly turned aside;[SEP]a blush that the question had ever come spread over her cheek, and she[SEP]caught her breath.[SEP]Ah, if you had seen her![SEP]I forgot the King in Zenda.[SEP]I forgot the King in Strelsau.[SEP]She was a princess--and I an impostor.[SEP]Do you think I remembered that?[SEP]I threw myself on my knee and seized[SEP]her hands in mine.[SEP]I said nothing.[SEP]Why should I?[SEP]The soft sounds of the[SEP]night set my wooing to a wordless melody, as I pressed my kisses on her[SEP]lips.[EOT]
[SOT]She pushed me from her, crying suddenly:[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah![SEP]is it true?[SEP]or is it only because you must?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s true![SEP]” I said, in low smothered tones--“true that I love you more[SEP]than life--or truth--or honour![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She set no meaning to my words, treating them as one of love’s sweet[SEP]extravagances.[SEP]She came close to me, and whispered:[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, if you were not the King![SEP]Then I could show you how I love you![SEP]How[SEP]is it that I love you now, Rudolf?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes--just lately.[SEP]I--I never did before.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Pure triumph filled me.[SEP]It was I--Rudolf Rassendyll--who had won her![SEP]I[SEP]caught her round the waist.[EOT]
[SOT]“You didn’t love me before?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]She looked up into my face, smiling, as she whispered:[EOT]
[SOT]“It must have been your Crown.[SEP]I felt it first on the Coronation Day.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Never before?[SEP]” I asked eagerly.[EOT]
[SOT]She laughed low.[EOT]
[SOT]“You speak as if you would be pleased to hear me say ‘Yes’ to that,” she[SEP]said.[EOT]
[SOT]“Would ‘Yes’ be true?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes,” I just heard her breathe, and she went on in an instant: “Be[SEP]careful, Rudolf; be careful, dear.[SEP]He will be mad now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What, Michael?[SEP]If Michael were the worst--”[EOT]
[SOT]“What worse is there?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]There was yet a chance for me.[SEP]Controlling myself with a mighty effort,[SEP]I took my hands off her and stood a yard or two away.[SEP]I remember now the[SEP]note of the wind in the elm trees outside.[EOT]
[SOT]“If I were not the King,” I began, “if I were only a private[SEP]gentleman--”[EOT]
[SOT]Before I could finish, her hand was in mine.[EOT]
[SOT]“If you were a convict in the prison of Strelsau, you would be my King,”[SEP]she said.[EOT]
[SOT]And under my breath I groaned, “God forgive me![SEP]” and, holding her hand[SEP]in mine, I said again:[EOT]
[SOT]“If I were not the King--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Hush, hush![SEP]” she whispered.[SEP]“I don’t deserve it--I don’t deserve to be[SEP]doubted.[SEP]Ah, Rudolf![SEP]does a woman who marries without love look on the[SEP]man as I look on you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]And she hid her face from me.[EOT]
[SOT]For more than a minute we stood there together; and I, even with my arm[SEP]about her, summoned up what honour and conscience her beauty and the[SEP]toils that I was in had left me.[EOT]
[SOT]“Flavia,” I said, in a strange dry voice that seemed not my own, “I am[SEP]not--”[EOT]
[SOT]As I spoke--as she raised her eyes to me--there was a heavy step on the[SEP]gravel outside, and a man appeared at the window.[SEP]A little cry burst[SEP]from Flavia, as she sprang back from me.[SEP]My half-finished sentence died[SEP]on my lips.[SEP]Sapt stood there, bowing low, but with a stern frown on his[SEP]face.[EOT]
[SOT]“A thousand pardons, sire,” said he, “but his Eminence the Cardinal has[SEP]waited this quarter of an hour to offer his respectful adieu to your[SEP]Majesty.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I met his eye full and square; and I read in it an angry warning.[SEP]How[SEP]long he had been a listener I knew not, but he had come in upon us in[SEP]the nick of time.[EOT]
[SOT]“We must not keep his Eminence waiting,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]But Flavia, in whose love there lay no shame, with radiant eyes and[SEP]blushing face, held out her hand to Sapt.[SEP]She said nothing, but no[SEP]man could have missed her meaning, who had ever seen a woman in the[SEP]exultation of love.[SEP]A sour, yet sad, smile passed over the old soldier’s[SEP]face, and there was tenderness in his voice, as bending to kiss her[SEP]hand, he said:[EOT]
[SOT]“In joy and sorrow, in good times and bad, God save your Royal[SEP]Highness![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He paused and added, glancing at me and drawing himself up to military[SEP]erectness:[EOT]
[SOT]“But, before all comes the King--God save the King![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]And Flavia caught at my hand and kissed it, murmuring:[EOT]
[SOT]“Amen![SEP]Good God, Amen![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]We went into the ballroom again.[SEP]Forced to receive adieus, I was[SEP]separated from Flavia: everyone, when they left me, went to her.[SEP]Sapt[SEP]was out and in of the throng, and where he had been, glances, smiles,[SEP]and whispers were rife.[SEP]I doubted not that, true to his relentless[SEP]purpose, he was spreading the news that he had learnt.[SEP]To uphold[SEP]the Crown and beat Black Michael--that was his one resolve.[SEP]Flavia,[SEP]myself--ay, and the real King in Zenda, were pieces in his game; and[SEP]pawns have no business with passions.[SEP]Not even at the walls of the[SEP]Palace did he stop; for when at last I handed Flavia down the broad[SEP]marble steps and into her carriage, there was a great crowd awaiting[SEP]us, and we were welcomed with deafening cheers.[SEP]What could I do?[SEP]Had I[SEP]spoken then, they would have refused to believe that I was not the King;[SEP]they might have believed that the King had run mad.[SEP]By Sapt’s devices[SEP]and my own ungoverned passion I had been forced on, and the way back had[SEP]closed behind me; and the passion still drove me in the same direction[SEP]as the devices seduced me.[SEP]I faced all Strelsau that night as the King[SEP]and the accepted suitor of the Princess Flavia.[EOT]
[SOT]At last, at three in the morning, when the cold light of dawning day[SEP]began to steal in, I was in my dressing-room, and Sapt alone was with[SEP]me.[SEP]I sat like a man dazed, staring into the fire; he puffed at his[SEP]pipe; Fritz was gone to bed, having almost refused to speak to me.[SEP]On[SEP]the table by me lay a rose; it had been in Flavia’s dress, and, as we[SEP]parted, she had kissed it and given it to me.[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt advanced his hand towards the rose, but, with a quick movement, I[SEP]shut mine down upon it.[EOT]
[SOT]“That’s mine,” I said, “not yours--nor the King’s either.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“We struck a good blow for the King tonight,” said he.[EOT]
[SOT]I turned on him fiercely.[EOT]
[SOT]“What’s to prevent me striking a blow for myself?[SEP]” I said.[EOT]
[SOT]He nodded his head.[EOT]
[SOT]“I know what’s in your mind,” he said.[SEP]“Yes, lad; but you’re bound in[SEP]honour.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Have you left me any honour?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, come, to play a little trick on a girl--”[EOT]
[SOT]“You can spare me that.[SEP]Colonel Sapt, if you would not have me utterly a[SEP]villain--if you would not have your King rot in Zenda, while Michael and[SEP]I play for the great stake outside--You follow me?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, I follow you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“We must act, and quickly![SEP]You saw tonight--you heard--tonight--”[EOT]
[SOT]“I did,” said he.[EOT]
[SOT]“Your cursed acuteness told you what I should do.[SEP]Well, leave me here a[SEP]week--and there’s another problem for you.[SEP]Do you find the answer?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, I find it,” he answered, frowning heavily.[SEP]“But if you did that,[SEP]you’d have to fight me first--and kill me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, and if I had--or a score of men?[SEP]I tell you, I could raise all[SEP]Strelsau on you in an hour, and choke you with your lies--yes, your mad[SEP]lies--in your mouth.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s gospel truth,” he said--“thanks to my advice you could.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I could marry the princess, and send Michael and his brother together[SEP]to--”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m not denying it, lad,” said he.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then, in God’s name,” I cried, stretching out my hands to him, “let us[SEP]go to Zenda and crush this Michael and bring the King back to his own[SEP]again.[SEP]” The old fellow stood and looked at me for full a minute.[EOT]
[SOT]“And the princess?[SEP]” he said.[EOT]
[SOT]I bowed my head to meet my hands, and crushed the rose between my[SEP]fingers and my lips.[EOT]
[SOT]I felt his hand on my shoulder, and his voice sounded husky as he[SEP]whispered low in my ear:[EOT]
[SOT]“Before God, you’re the finest Elphberg of them all.[SEP]But I have eaten[SEP]of the King’s bread, and I am the King’s servant.[SEP]Come, we will go to[SEP]Zenda![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]And I looked up and caught him by the hand.[SEP]And the eyes of both of us[SEP]were wet.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER 11[EOT]
[SOT]Hunting a Very Big Boar[EOT]
[SOT]The terrible temptation which was assailing me will now be understood.[SEP]I would so force Michael’s hand that he must kill the King.[SEP]I was in a[SEP]position to bid him defiance and tighten my grasp on the crown--not for[SEP]its own sake, but because the King of Ruritania was to wed the Princess[SEP]Flavia.[SEP]What of Sapt and Fritz?[SEP]Ah![SEP]but a man cannot be held to write[SEP]down in cold blood the wild and black thoughts that storm his brain when[SEP]an uncontrolled passion has battered a breach for them.[SEP]Yet, unless[SEP]he sets up as a saint, he need not hate himself for them.[SEP]He is better[SEP]employed, as it humbly seems to me, in giving thanks that power to[SEP]resist was vouchsafed to him, than in fretting over wicked impulses[SEP]which come unsought and extort an unwilling hospitality from the[SEP]weakness of our nature.[EOT]
[SOT]It was a fine bright morning when I walked, unattended, to the[SEP]princess’s house, carrying a nosegay in my hand.[SEP]Policy made excuses[SEP]for love, and every attention that I paid her, while it riveted my own[SEP]chains, bound closer to me the people of the great city, who worshipped[SEP]her.[SEP]I found Fritz’s _inamorata_, the Countess Helga, gathering blooms in[SEP]the garden for her mistress’s wear, and prevailed on her to take mine in[SEP]their place.[SEP]The girl was rosy with happiness, for Fritz, in his turn,[SEP]had not wasted his evening, and no dark shadow hung over his wooing,[SEP]save the hatred which the Duke of Strelsau was known to bear him.[EOT]
[SOT]“And that,” she said, with a mischievous smile, “your Majesty has made[SEP]of no moment.[SEP]Yes, I will take the flowers; shall I tell you, sire, what[SEP]is the first thing the princess does with them?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]We were talking on a broad terrace that ran along the back of the house,[SEP]and a window above our heads stood open.[EOT]
[SOT]“Madame![SEP]” cried the countess merrily, and Flavia herself looked out.[SEP]I[SEP]bared my head and bowed.[SEP]She wore a white gown, and her hair was loosely[SEP]gathered in a knot.[SEP]She kissed her hand to me, crying:[EOT]
[SOT]“Bring the King up, Helga; I’ll give him some coffee.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The countess, with a gay glance, led the way, and took me into Flavia’s[SEP]morning-room.[SEP]And, left alone, we greeted one another as lovers are[SEP]wont.[SEP]Then the princess laid two letters before me.[SEP]One was from Black[SEP]Michael--a most courteous request that she would honour him by spending[SEP]a day at his Castle of Zenda, as had been her custom once a year in the[SEP]summer, when the place and its gardens were in the height of their great[SEP]beauty.[SEP]I threw the letter down in disgust, and Flavia laughed at me.[SEP]Then, growing grave again, she pointed to the other sheet.[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t know who that comes from,” she said.[SEP]“Read it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I knew in a moment.[SEP]There was no signature at all this time, but the[SEP]handwriting was the same as that which had told me of the snare in the[SEP]summer-house: it was Antoinette de Mauban’s.[EOT]
[SOT]“I have no cause to love you,” it ran, “but God forbid that you should[SEP]fall into the power of the duke.[SEP]Accept no invitations of his.[SEP]Go[SEP]nowhere without a large guard--a regiment is not too much to make you[SEP]safe.[SEP]Show this, if you can, to him who reigns in Strelsau.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why doesn’t it say ‘the King’?[SEP]” asked Flavia, leaning over my shoulder,[SEP]so that the ripple of her hair played on my cheek.[SEP]“Is it a hoax?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“As you value life, and more than life, my queen,” I said, “obey it to[SEP]the very letter.[SEP]A regiment shall camp round your house today.[SEP]See that[SEP]you do not go out unless well guarded.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“An order, sire?[SEP]” she asked, a little rebellious.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, an order, madame--if you love me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah![SEP]” she cried; and I could not but kiss her.[EOT]
[SOT]“You know who sent it?[SEP]” she asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“I guess,” said I.[SEP]“It is from a good friend--and I fear, an unhappy[SEP]woman.[SEP]You must be ill, Flavia, and unable to go to Zenda.[SEP]Make your[SEP]excuses as cold and formal as you like.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“So you feel strong enough to anger Michael?[SEP]” she said, with a proud[SEP]smile.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m strong enough for anything, while you are safe,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]Soon I tore myself away from her, and then, without consulting Sapt, I[SEP]took my way to the house of Marshal Strakencz.[SEP]I had seen something[SEP]of the old general, and I liked and trusted him.[SEP]Sapt was less[SEP]enthusiastic, but I had learnt by now that Sapt was best pleased when[SEP]he could do everything, and jealousy played some part in his views.[SEP]As[SEP]things were now, I had more work than Sapt and Fritz could manage, for[SEP]they must come with me to Zenda, and I wanted a man to guard what I[SEP]loved most in all the world, and suffer me to set about my task of[SEP]releasing the King with a quiet mind.[EOT]
[SOT]The Marshal received me with most loyal kindness.[SEP]To some extent, I took[SEP]him into my confidence.[SEP]I charged him with the care of the princess,[SEP]looking him full and significantly in the face as I bade him let no one[SEP]from her cousin the duke approach her, unless he himself were there and[SEP]a dozen of his men with him.[EOT]
[SOT]“You may be right, sire,” said he, shaking his grey head sadly.[SEP]“I have[SEP]known better men than the duke do worse things than that for love.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I could quite appreciate the remark, but I said:[EOT]
[SOT]“There’s something beside love, Marshal.[SEP]Love’s for the heart; is there[SEP]nothing my brother might like for his head?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I pray that you wrong him, sire.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Marshal, I’m leaving Strelsau for a few days.[SEP]Every evening I will[SEP]send a courier to you.[SEP]If for three days none comes, you will publish an[SEP]order which I will give you, depriving Duke Michael of the governorship[SEP]of Strelsau and appointing you in his place.[SEP]You will declare a state of[SEP]siege.[SEP]Then you will send word to Michael that you demand an audience of[SEP]the King--You follow me?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, sire.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“--In twenty-four hours.[SEP]If he does not produce the King” (I laid my[SEP]hand on his knee), “then the King is dead, and you will proclaim the[SEP]next heir.[SEP]You know who that is?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The Princess Flavia.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And swear to me, on your faith and honour and by the fear of the living[SEP]God, that you will stand by her to the death, and kill that reptile, and[SEP]seat her where I sit now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“On my faith and honour, and by the fear of God, I swear it![SEP]And may[SEP]Almighty God preserve your Majesty, for I think that you go on an errand[SEP]of danger.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I hope that no life more precious than mine may be demanded,” said I,[SEP]rising.[SEP]Then I held out my hand to him.[EOT]
[SOT]“Marshal,” I said, “in days to come, it may be--I know not--that you[SEP]will hear strange things of the man who speaks to you now.[SEP]Let him be[SEP]what he may, and who he may, what say you of the manner in which he has[SEP]borne himself as King in Strelsau?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The old man, holding my hand, spoke to me, man to man.[EOT]
[SOT]“I have known many of the Elphbergs,” said he, “and I have seen you.[SEP]And, happen what may, you have borne yourself as a wise King and a brave[SEP]man; ay, and you have proved as courteous a gentleman and as gallant a[SEP]lover as any that have been of the House.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Be that my epitaph,” said I, “when the time comes that another sits on[SEP]the throne of Ruritania.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“God send a far day, and may I not see it![SEP]” said he.[EOT]
[SOT]I was much moved, and the Marshal’s worn face twitched.[SEP]I sat down and[SEP]wrote my order.[EOT]
[SOT]“I can hardly yet write,” said I; “my finger is stiff still.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]It was, in fact, the first time that I had ventured to write more than[SEP]a signature; and in spite of the pains I had taken to learn the King’s[SEP]hand, I was not yet perfect in it.[EOT]
[SOT]“Indeed, sire,” he said, “it differs a little from your ordinary[SEP]handwriting.[SEP]It is unfortunate, for it may lead to a suspicion of[SEP]forgery.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Marshal,” said I, with a laugh, “what use are the guns of Strelsau, if[SEP]they can’t assuage a little suspicion?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He smiled grimly, and took the paper.[EOT]
[SOT]“Colonel Sapt and Fritz von Tarlenheim go with me,” I continued.[EOT]
[SOT]“You go to seek the duke?[SEP]” he asked in a low tone.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, the duke, and someone else of whom I have need, and who is at[SEP]Zenda,” I replied.[EOT]
[SOT]“I wish I could go with you,” he cried, tugging at his white moustache.[SEP]“I’d like to strike a blow for you and your crown.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I leave you what is more than my life and more than my crown,” said I,[SEP]“because you are the man I trust more than all other in Ruritania.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I will deliver her to you safe and sound,” said he, “and, failing that,[SEP]I will make her queen.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]We parted, and I returned to the Palace and told Sapt and Fritz what[SEP]I had done.[SEP]Sapt had a few faults to find and a few grumbles to[SEP]utter.[SEP]This was merely what I expected, for Sapt liked to be consulted[SEP]beforehand, not informed afterwards; but on the whole he approved of my[SEP]plans, and his spirits rose high as the hour of action drew nearer and[SEP]nearer.[SEP]Fritz, too, was ready; though he, poor fellow, risked more than[SEP]Sapt did, for he was a lover, and his happiness hung in the scale.[SEP]Yet[SEP]how I envied him![SEP]For the triumphant issue which would crown him with[SEP]happiness and unite him to his mistress, the success for which we were[SEP]bound to hope and strive and struggle, meant to me sorrow more certain[SEP]and greater than if I were doomed to fail.[SEP]He understood something of[SEP]this, for when we were alone (save for old Sapt, who was smoking at the[SEP]other end of the room) he passed his arm through mine, saying:[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s hard for you.[SEP]Don’t think I don’t trust you; I know you have[SEP]nothing but true thoughts in your heart.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]But I turned away from him, thankful that he could not see what my heart[SEP]held, but only be witness to the deeds that my hands were to do.[EOT]
[SOT]Yet even he did not understand, for he had not dared to lift his eyes to[SEP]the Princess Flavia, as I had lifted mine.[EOT]
[SOT]Our plans were now all made, even as we proceeded to carry them out, and[SEP]as they will hereafter appear.[SEP]The next morning we were to start on the[SEP]hunting excursion.[SEP]I had made all arrangements for being absent, and[SEP]now there was only one thing left to do--the hardest, the most[SEP]heart-breaking.[SEP]As evening fell, I drove through the busy streets to[SEP]Flavia’s residence.[SEP]I was recognized as I went and heartily cheered.[SEP]I[SEP]played my part, and made shift to look the happy lover.[SEP]In spite of my[SEP]depression, I was almost amused at the coolness and delicate hauteur[SEP]with which my sweet lover received me.[SEP]She had heard that the King was[SEP]leaving Strelsau on a hunting expedition.[EOT]
[SOT]“I regret that we cannot amuse your Majesty here in Strelsau,” she said,[SEP]tapping her foot lightly on the floor.[SEP]“I would have offered you more[SEP]entertainment, but I was foolish enough to think--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, what?[SEP]” I asked, leaning over her.[EOT]
[SOT]“That just for a day or two after--after last night--you might be happy[SEP]without much gaiety;” and she turned pettishly from me, as she added, “I[SEP]hope the boars will be more engrossing.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m going after a very big boar,” said I; and, because I could not help[SEP]it, I began to play with her hair, but she moved her head away.[EOT]
[SOT]“Are you offended with me?[SEP]” I asked, in feigned surprise, for I could[SEP]not resist tormenting her a little.[SEP]I had never seen her angry, and[SEP]every fresh aspect of her was a delight to me.[EOT]
[SOT]“What right have I to be offended?[SEP]True, you said last night that every[SEP]hour away from me was wasted.[SEP]But a very big boar![SEP]that’s a different[SEP]thing.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Perhaps the boar will hunt me,” I suggested.[SEP]“Perhaps, Flavia, he’ll[SEP]catch me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She made no answer.[EOT]
[SOT]“You are not touched even by that danger?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Still she said nothing; and I, stealing round, found her eyes full of[SEP]tears.[EOT]
[SOT]“You weep for my danger?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Then she spoke very low:[EOT]
[SOT]“This is like what you used to be; but not like the King--the King I--I[SEP]have come to love![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]With a sudden great groan, I caught her to my heart.[EOT]
[SOT]“My darling![SEP]” I cried, forgetting everything but her, “did you dream[SEP]that I left you to go hunting?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What then, Rudolf?[SEP]Ah![SEP]you’re not going--?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, it is hunting.[SEP]I go to seek Michael in his lair.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She had turned very pale.[EOT]
[SOT]“So, you see, sweet, I was not so poor a lover as you thought me.[SEP]I[SEP]shall not be long gone.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You will write to me, Rudolf?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I was weak, but I could not say a word to stir suspicion in her.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ll send you all my heart every day,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“And you’ll run no danger?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“None that I need not.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And when will you be back?[SEP]Ah, how long will it be![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“When shall I be back?[SEP]” I repeated.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, yes![SEP]Don’t be long, dear, don’t be long.[SEP]I shan’t sleep while[SEP]you’re away.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t know when I shall be back,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“Soon, Rudolf, soon?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“God knows, my darling.[SEP]But, if never--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Hush, hush![SEP]” and she pressed her lips to mine.[EOT]
[SOT]“If never,” I whispered, “you must take my place; you’ll be the only one[SEP]of the House then.[SEP]You must reign, and not weep for me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]For a moment she drew herself up like a very queen.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, I will![SEP]” she said.[SEP]“I will reign.[SEP]I will do my part though all my[SEP]life will be empty and my heart dead; yet I’ll do it![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She paused, and sinking against me again, wailed softly.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come soon![SEP]come soon![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Carried away, I cried loudly:[EOT]
[SOT]“As God lives, I--yes, I myself--will see you once more before I die![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What do you mean?[SEP]” she exclaimed, with wondering eyes; but I had no[SEP]answer for her, and she gazed at me with her wondering eyes.[EOT]
[SOT]I dared not ask her to forget, she would have found it an insult.[SEP]I[SEP]could not tell her then who and what I was.[SEP]She was weeping, and I had[SEP]but to dry her tears.[EOT]
[SOT]“Shall a man not come back to the loveliest lady in all the wide world?[SEP]”[SEP]said I.[SEP]“A thousand Michaels should not keep me from you![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She clung to me, a little comforted.[EOT]
[SOT]“You won’t let Michael hurt you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No, sweetheart.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Or keep you from me?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No, sweetheart.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Nor anyone else?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]And again I answered:[EOT]
[SOT]“No, sweetheart.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Yet there was one--not Michael--who, if he lived, must keep me from[SEP]her; and for whose life I was going forth to stake my own.[SEP]And his[SEP]figure--the lithe, buoyant figure I had met in the woods of Zenda--the[SEP]dull, inert mass I had left in the cellar of the hunting-lodge--seemed[SEP]to rise, double-shaped, before me, and to come between us, thrusting[SEP]itself in even where she lay, pale, exhausted, fainting, in my arms, and[SEP]yet looking up at me with those eyes that bore such love as I have never[SEP]seen, and haunt me now, and will till the ground closes over me--and[SEP](who knows?[SEP]) perhaps beyond.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER 12[EOT]
[SOT]I Receive a Visitor and Bait a Hook[EOT]
[SOT]About five miles from Zenda--on the opposite side from that on which[SEP]the Castle is situated, there lies a large tract of wood.[SEP]It is rising[SEP]ground, and in the centre of the demesne, on the top of the hill, stands[SEP]a fine modern chateau, the property of a distant kinsman of Fritz’s, the[SEP]Count Stanislas von Tarlenheim.[SEP]Count Stanislas himself was a student[SEP]and a recluse.[SEP]He seldom visited the house, and had, on Fritz’s request,[SEP]very readily and courteously offered me its hospitality for myself and[SEP]my party.[SEP]This, then, was our destination; chosen ostensibly for the[SEP]sake of the boar-hunting (for the wood was carefully preserved, and[SEP]boars, once common all over Ruritania, were still to be found there[SEP]in considerable numbers), really because it brought us within striking[SEP]distance of the Duke of Strelsau’s more magnificent dwelling on the[SEP]other side of the town.[SEP]A large party of servants, with horses and[SEP]luggage, started early in the morning; we followed at midday, travelling[SEP]by train for thirty miles, and then mounting our horses to ride the[SEP]remaining distance to the chateau.[EOT]
[SOT]We were a gallant party.[SEP]Besides Sapt and Fritz, I was accompanied by[SEP]ten gentlemen: every one of them had been carefully chosen, and no less[SEP]carefully sounded, by my two friends, and all were devotedly attached to[SEP]the person of the King.[SEP]They were told a part of the truth; the attempt[SEP]on my life in the summer-house was revealed to them, as a spur to their[SEP]loyalty and an incitement against Michael.[SEP]They were also informed that[SEP]a friend of the King’s was suspected to be forcibly confined within the[SEP]Castle of Zenda.[SEP]His rescue was one of the objects of the expedition;[SEP]but, it was added, the King’s main desire was to carry into effect[SEP]certain steps against his treacherous brother, as to the precise nature[SEP]of which they could not at present be further enlightened.[SEP]Enough that[SEP]the King commanded their services, and would rely on their devotion when[SEP]occasion arose to call for it.[SEP]Young, well-bred, brave, and loyal, they[SEP]asked no more: they were ready to prove their dutiful obedience, and[SEP]prayed for a fight as the best and most exhilarating mode of showing it.[EOT]
[SOT]Thus the scene was shifted from Strelsau to the chateau of Tarlenheim[SEP]and Castle of Zenda, which frowned at us across the valley.[SEP]I tried to[SEP]shift my thoughts also, to forget my love, and to bend all my energies[SEP]to the task before me.[SEP]It was to get the King out of the Castle alive.[SEP]Force was useless: in some trick lay the chance; and I had already an[SEP]inkling of what we must do.[SEP]But I was terribly hampered by the publicity[SEP]which attended my movements.[SEP]Michael must know by now of my expedition;[SEP]and I knew Michael too well to suppose that his eyes would be blinded by[SEP]the feint of the boar-hunt.[SEP]He would understand very well what the real[SEP]quarry was.[SEP]That, however, must be risked--that and all it might mean;[SEP]for Sapt, no less than myself, recognized that the present state of[SEP]things had become unendurable.[SEP]And there was one thing that I dared to[SEP]calculate on--not, as I now know, without warrant.[SEP]It was this--that[SEP]Black Michael would not believe that I meant well by the King.[SEP]He could[SEP]not appreciate--I will not say an honest man, for the thoughts of my[SEP]own heart have been revealed--but a man acting honestly.[SEP]He saw[SEP]my opportunity as I had seen it, as Sapt had seen it; he knew the[SEP]princess--nay (and I declare that a sneaking sort of pity for him[SEP]invaded me), in his way he loved her; he would think that Sapt and Fritz[SEP]could be bribed, so the bribe was large enough.[SEP]Thinking thus, would he[SEP]kill the King, my rival and my danger?[SEP]Ay, verily, that he would, with[SEP]as little compunction as he would kill a rat.[SEP]But he would kill Rudolf[SEP]Rassendyll first, if he could; and nothing but the certainty of being[SEP]utterly damned by the release of the King alive and his restoration to[SEP]the throne would drive him to throw away the trump card which he held in[SEP]reserve to baulk the supposed game of the impudent impostor Rassendyll.[SEP]Musing on all this as I rode along, I took courage.[EOT]
[SOT]Michael knew of my coming, sure enough.[SEP]I had not been in the house an[SEP]hour, when an imposing Embassy arrived from him.[SEP]He did not quite reach[SEP]the impudence of sending my would-be assassins, but he sent the other[SEP]three of his famous Six--the three Ruritanian gentlemen--Lauengram,[SEP]Krafstein, and Rupert Hentzau.[SEP]A fine, strapping trio they were,[SEP]splendidly horsed and admirably equipped.[SEP]Young Rupert, who looked[SEP]a dare-devil, and could not have been more than twenty-two or[SEP]twenty-three, took the lead, and made us the neatest speech, wherein[SEP]my devoted subject and loving brother Michael of Strelsau, prayed me to[SEP]pardon him for not paying his addresses in person, and, further, for not[SEP]putting his Castle at my disposal; the reason for both of these apparent[SEP]derelictions being that he and several of his servants lay sick of[SEP]scarlet fever, and were in a very sad, and also a very infectious state.[SEP]So declared young Rupert with an insolent smile on his curling upper lip[SEP]and a toss of his thick hair--he was a handsome villain, and the gossip[SEP]ran that many a lady had troubled her heart for him already.[EOT]
[SOT]“If my brother has scarlet fever,” said I, “he is nearer my complexion[SEP]than he is wont to be, my lord.[SEP]I trust he does not suffer?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He is able to attend to his affairs, sire.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I hope all beneath your roof are not sick.[SEP]What of my good friends, De[SEP]Gautet, Bersonin, and Detchard?[SEP]I heard the last had suffered a hurt.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Lauengram and Krafstein looked glum and uneasy, but young Rupert’s smile[SEP]grew broader.[EOT]
[SOT]“He hopes soon to find a medicine for it, sire,” he answered.[EOT]
[SOT]And I burst out laughing, for I knew what medicine Detchard longed[SEP]for--it is called Revenge.[EOT]
[SOT]“You will dine with us, gentlemen?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]Young Rupert was profuse in apologies.[SEP]They had urgent duties at the[SEP]Castle.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then,” said I, with a wave of my hand, “to our next meeting, gentlemen.[SEP]May it make us better acquainted.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“We will pray your Majesty for an early opportunity,” quoth Rupert[SEP]airily; and he strode past Sapt with such jeering scorn on his face that[SEP]I saw the old fellow clench his fist and scowl black as night.[EOT]
[SOT]For my part, if a man must needs be a knave, I would have him a debonair[SEP]knave, and I liked Rupert Hentzau better than his long-faced, close-eyed[SEP]companions.[SEP]It makes your sin no worse, as I conceive, to do it _à la[SEP]mode_ and stylishly.[EOT]
[SOT]Now it was a curious thing that on this first night, instead of eating[SEP]the excellent dinner my cooks had prepared for me, I must needs leave my[SEP]gentlemen to eat it alone, under Sapt’s presiding care, and ride myself[SEP]with Fritz to the town of Zenda and a certain little inn that I knew[SEP]of.[SEP]There was little danger in the excursion; the evenings were long and[SEP]light, and the road this side of Zenda well frequented.[SEP]So off we rode,[SEP]with a groom behind us.[SEP]I muffled myself up in a big cloak.[EOT]
[SOT]“Fritz,” said I, as we entered the town, “there’s an uncommonly pretty[SEP]girl at this inn.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“How do you know?[SEP]” he asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Because I’ve been there,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“Since--?[SEP]” he began.[EOT]
[SOT]“No. Before,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“But they’ll recognize you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, of course they will.[SEP]Now, don’t argue, my good fellow, but listen[SEP]to me.[SEP]We’re two gentlemen of the King’s household, and one of us has a[SEP]toothache.[SEP]The other will order a private room and dinner, and, further,[SEP]a bottle of the best wine for the sufferer.[SEP]And if he be as clever a[SEP]fellow as I take him for, the pretty girl and no other will wait on us.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What if she won’t?[SEP]” objected Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]“My dear Fritz,” said I, “if she won’t for you, she will for me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]We were at the inn.[SEP]Nothing of me but my eyes was visible as I walked[SEP]in.[SEP]The landlady received us; two minutes later, my little friend (ever,[SEP]I fear me, on the look-out for such guests as might prove amusing) made[SEP]her appearance.[SEP]Dinner and the wine were ordered.[SEP]I sat down in the[SEP]private room.[SEP]A minute later Fritz came in.[EOT]
[SOT]“She’s coming,” he said.[EOT]
[SOT]“If she were not, I should have to doubt the Countess Helga’s taste.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She came in.[SEP]I gave her time to set the wine down--I didn’t want it[SEP]dropped.[SEP]Fritz poured out a glass and gave it to me.[EOT]
[SOT]“Is the gentleman in great pain?[SEP]” the girl asked, sympathetically.[EOT]
[SOT]“The gentleman is no worse than when he saw you last,” said I, throwing[SEP]away my cloak.[EOT]
[SOT]She started, with a little shriek.[SEP]Then she cried:[EOT]
[SOT]“It was the King, then![SEP]I told mother so the moment I saw his picture.[SEP]Oh, sir, forgive me![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Faith, you gave me nothing that hurt much,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“But the things we said![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I forgive them for the thing you did.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I must go and tell mother.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Stop,” said I, assuming a graver air.[SEP]“We are not here for sport[SEP]tonight.[SEP]Go and bring dinner, and not a word of the King being here.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She came back in a few minutes, looking grave, yet very curious.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, how is Johann?[SEP]” I asked, beginning my dinner.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, that fellow, sir--my lord King, I mean![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“‘Sir’ will do, please.[SEP]How is he?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“We hardly see him now, sir.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And why not?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I told him he came too often, sir,” said she, tossing her head.[EOT]
[SOT]“So he sulks and stays away?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, sir.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But you could bring him back?[SEP]” I suggested with a smile.[EOT]
[SOT]“Perhaps I could,” said she.[EOT]
[SOT]“I know your powers, you see,” said I, and she blushed with pleasure.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s not only that, sir, that keeps him away.[SEP]He’s very busy at the[SEP]Castle.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“But there’s no shooting on now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No, sir; but he’s in charge of the house.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Johann turned housemaid?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The little girl was brimming over with gossip.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, there are no others,” said she.[SEP]“There’s not a woman there--not[SEP]as a servant, I mean.[SEP]They do say--but perhaps it’s false, sir.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Let’s have it for what it’s worth,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“Indeed, I’m ashamed to tell you, sir.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, see, I’m looking at the ceiling.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“They do say there is a lady there, sir; but, except for her, there’s[SEP]not a woman in the place.[SEP]And Johann has to wait on the gentlemen.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Poor Johann![SEP]He must be overworked.[SEP]Yet I’m sure he could find half an[SEP]hour to come and see you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It would depend on the time, sir, perhaps.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Do you love him?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Not I, sir.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And you wish to serve the King?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, sir.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Then tell him to meet you at the second milestone out of Zenda tomorrow[SEP]evening at ten o’clock.[SEP]Say you’ll be there and will walk home with[SEP]him.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Do you mean him harm, sir?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Not if he will do as I bid him.[SEP]But I think I’ve told you enough, my[SEP]pretty maid.[SEP]See that you do as I bid you.[SEP]And, mind, no one is to know[SEP]that the King has been here.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I spoke a little sternly, for there is seldom harm in infusing a little[SEP]fear into a woman’s liking for you, and I softened the effect by giving[SEP]her a handsome present.[SEP]Then we dined, and, wrapping my cloak about[SEP]my face, with Fritz leading the way, we went downstairs to our horses[SEP]again.[EOT]
[SOT]It was but half-past eight, and hardly yet dark; the streets were full[SEP]for such a quiet little place, and I could see that gossip was all agog.[SEP]With the King on one side and the duke on the other, Zenda felt itself[SEP]the centre of all Ruritania.[SEP]We jogged gently through the town, but set[SEP]our horses to a sharper pace when we reached the open country.[EOT]
[SOT]“You want to catch this fellow Johann?[SEP]” asked Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, and I fancy I’ve baited the hook right.[SEP]Our little Delilah will[SEP]bring our Samson.[SEP]It is not enough, Fritz, to have no women in a house,[SEP]though brother Michael shows some wisdom there.[SEP]If you want safety, you[SEP]must have none within fifty miles.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“None nearer than Strelsau, for instance,” said poor Fritz, with a[SEP]lovelorn sigh.[EOT]
[SOT]We reached the avenue of the chateau, and were soon at the house.[SEP]As the[SEP]hoofs of our horses sounded on the gravel, Sapt rushed out to meet us.[EOT]
[SOT]“Thank God, you’re safe![SEP]” he cried.[SEP]“Have you seen anything of them?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Of whom?[SEP]” I asked, dismounting.[EOT]
[SOT]He drew us aside, that the grooms might not hear.[EOT]
[SOT]“Lad,” he said to me, “you must not ride about here, unless with half a[SEP]dozen of us.[SEP]You know among our men a tall young fellow, Bernenstein by[SEP]name?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I knew him.[SEP]He was a fine strapping young man, almost of my height, and[SEP]of light complexion.[EOT]
[SOT]“He lies in his room upstairs, with a bullet through his arm.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The deuce he does![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“After dinner he strolled out alone, and went a mile or so into the[SEP]wood; and as he walked, he thought he saw three men among the trees;[SEP]and one levelled a gun at him.[SEP]He had no weapon, and he started at a run[SEP]back towards the house.[SEP]But one of them fired, and he was hit, and had[SEP]much ado to reach here before he fainted.[SEP]By good luck, they feared to[SEP]pursue him nearer the house.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He paused and added:[EOT]
[SOT]“Lad, the bullet was meant for you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It is very likely,” said I, “and it’s first blood to brother Michael.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I wonder which three it was,” said Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, Sapt,” I said, “I went out tonight for no idle purpose, as you[SEP]shall hear.[SEP]But there’s one thing in my mind.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What’s that?[SEP]” he asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why this,” I answered.[SEP]“That I shall ill requite the very great honours[SEP]Ruritania has done me if I depart from it leaving one of those Six[SEP]alive--neither with the help of God, will I.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]And Sapt shook my hand on that.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER 13[EOT]
[SOT]An Improvement on Jacob’s Ladder[EOT]
[SOT]In the morning of the day after that on which I swore my oath against[SEP]the Six, I gave certain orders, and then rested in greater contentment[SEP]than I had known for some time.[SEP]I was at work; and work, though it[SEP]cannot cure love, is yet a narcotic to it; so that Sapt, who grew[SEP]feverish, marvelled to see me sprawling in an armchair in the sunshine,[SEP]listening to one of my friends who sang me amorous songs in a mellow[SEP]voice and induced in me a pleasing melancholy.[SEP]Thus was I engaged when[SEP]young Rupert Hentzau, who feared neither man nor devil, and rode through[SEP]the demesne--where every tree might hide a marksman, for all he knew--as[SEP]though it had been the park at Strelsau, cantered up to where I lay,[SEP]bowing with burlesque deference, and craving private speech with me[SEP]in order to deliver a message from the Duke of Strelsau.[SEP]I made all[SEP]withdraw, and then he said, seating himself by me:[EOT]
[SOT]“The King is in love, it seems?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Not with life, my lord,” said I, smiling.[EOT]
[SOT]“It is well,” he rejoined.[SEP]“Come, we are alone, Rassendyll--”[EOT]
[SOT]I rose to a sitting posture.[EOT]
[SOT]“What’s the matter?[SEP]” he asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“I was about to call one of my gentlemen to bring your horse, my lord.[SEP]If you do not know how to address the King, my brother must find another[SEP]messenger.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why keep up the farce?[SEP]” he asked, negligently dusting his boot with his[SEP]glove.[EOT]
[SOT]“Because it is not finished yet; and meanwhile I’ll choose my own name.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, so be it![SEP]Yet I spoke in love for you; for indeed you are a man[SEP]after my own heart.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Saving my poor honesty,” said I, “maybe I am.[SEP]But that I keep faith[SEP]with men, and honour with women, maybe I am, my lord.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He darted a glance at me--a glance of anger.[EOT]
[SOT]“Is your mother dead?[SEP]” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, she’s dead.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“She may thank God,” said I, and I heard him curse me softly.[SEP]“Well,[SEP]what’s the message?[SEP]” I continued.[EOT]
[SOT]I had touched him on the raw, for all the world knew he had broken his[SEP]mother’s heart and flaunted his mistresses in her house; and his airy[SEP]manner was gone for the moment.[EOT]
[SOT]“The duke offers you more than I would,” he growled.[SEP]“A halter for[SEP]you, sire, was my suggestion.[SEP]But he offers you safe-conduct across the[SEP]frontier and a million crowns.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I prefer your offer, my lord, if I am bound to one.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You refuse?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Of course.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I told Michael you would;” and the villain, his temper restored,[SEP]gave me the sunniest of smiles.[SEP]“The fact is, between ourselves,” he[SEP]continued, “Michael doesn’t understand a gentleman.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I began to laugh.[EOT]
[SOT]“And you?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“I do,” he said.[SEP]“Well, well, the halter be it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m sorry you won’t live to see it,” I observed.[EOT]
[SOT]“Has his Majesty done me the honour to fasten a particular quarrel on[SEP]me?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I would you were a few years older, though.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, God gives years, but the devil gives increase,” laughed he.[SEP]“I can[SEP]hold my own.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“How is your prisoner?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“The K--?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Your prisoner.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I forgot your wishes, sire.[SEP]Well, he is alive.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He rose to his feet; I imitated him.[SEP]Then, with a smile, he said:[EOT]
[SOT]“And the pretty princess?[SEP]Faith, I’ll wager the next Elphberg will be[SEP]red enough, for all that Black Michael will be called his father.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I sprang a step towards him, clenching my hand.[SEP]He did not move an inch,[SEP]and his lip curled in insolent amusement.[EOT]
[SOT]“Go, while your skin’s whole![SEP]” I muttered.[SEP]He had repaid me with[SEP]interest my hit about his mother.[EOT]
[SOT]Then came the most audacious thing I have known in my life.[SEP]My friends[SEP]were some thirty yards away.[SEP]Rupert called to a groom to bring him his[SEP]horse, and dismissed the fellow with a crown.[SEP]The horse stood near.[SEP]I[SEP]stood still, suspecting nothing.[SEP]Rupert made as though to mount; then[SEP]he suddenly turned to me: his left hand resting in his belt, his right[SEP]outstretched: “Shake hands,” he said.[EOT]
[SOT]I bowed, and did as he had foreseen--I put my hands behind me.[SEP]Quicker[SEP]than thought, his left hand darted out at me, and a small dagger flashed[SEP]in the air; he struck me in the left shoulder--had I not swerved, it[SEP]had been my heart.[SEP]With a cry, I staggered back.[SEP]Without touching the[SEP]stirrup, he leapt upon his horse and was off like an arrow, pursued by[SEP]cries and revolver shots--the last as useless as the first--and I[SEP]sank into my chair, bleeding profusely, as I watched the devil’s brat[SEP]disappear down the long avenue.[SEP]My friends surrounded me, and then I[SEP]fainted.[EOT]
[SOT]I suppose that I was put to bed, and there lay, unconscious, or half[SEP]conscious, for many hours; for it was night when I awoke to my full[SEP]mind, and found Fritz beside me.[SEP]I was weak and weary, but he bade me be[SEP]of good cheer, saying that my wound would soon heal, and that meanwhile[SEP]all had gone well, for Johann, the keeper, had fallen into the snare we[SEP]had laid for him, and was even now in the house.[EOT]
[SOT]“And the queer thing is,” pursued Fritz, “that I fancy he’s not[SEP]altogether sorry to find himself here.[SEP]He seems to think that when[SEP]Black Michael has brought off his coup, witnesses of how it was[SEP]effected--saving, of course, the Six themselves--will not be at a[SEP]premium.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]This idea argued a shrewdness in our captive which led me to build[SEP]hopes on his assistance.[SEP]I ordered him to be brought in at once.[SEP]Sapt[SEP]conducted him, and set him in a chair by my bedside.[SEP]He was sullen, and[SEP]afraid; but, to say truth, after young Rupert’s exploit, we also had[SEP]our fears, and, if he got as far as possible from Sapt’s formidable[SEP]six-shooter, Sapt kept him as far as he could from me.[SEP]Moreover, when he[SEP]came in his hands were bound, but that I would not suffer.[EOT]
[SOT]I need not stay to recount the safeguards and rewards we promised the[SEP]fellow--all of which were honourably observed and paid, so that he lives[SEP]now in prosperity (though where I may not mention); and we were the more[SEP]free inasmuch as we soon learnt that he was rather a weak man than a[SEP]wicked, and had acted throughout this matter more from fear of the duke[SEP]and of his own brother Max than for any love of what was done.[SEP]But[SEP]he had persuaded all of his loyalty; and though not in their secret[SEP]counsels, was yet, by his knowledge of their dispositions within the[SEP]Castle, able to lay bare before us the very heart of their devices.[SEP]And[SEP]here, in brief, is his story:[EOT]
[SOT]Below the level of the ground in the Castle, approached by a flight of[SEP]stone steps which abutted on the end of the drawbridge, were situated[SEP]two small rooms, cut out of the rock itself.[SEP]The outer of the two had no[SEP]windows, but was always lighted with candles; the inner had one square[SEP]window, which gave upon the moat.[SEP]In the outer room there lay always,[SEP]day and night, three of the Six; and the instructions of Duke Michael[SEP]were, that on any attack being made on the outer room, the three were to[SEP]defend the door of it so long as they could without risk to themselves.[SEP]But, so soon as the door should be in danger of being forced, then[SEP]Rupert Hentzau or Detchard (for one of these two was always there)[SEP]should leave the others to hold it as long as they could, and himself[SEP]pass into the inner room, and, without more ado, kill the King who[SEP]lay there, well-treated indeed, but without weapons, and with his arms[SEP]confined in fine steel chains, which did not allow him to move his elbow[SEP]more than three inches from his side.[SEP]Thus, before the outer door were[SEP]stormed, the King would be dead.[SEP]And his body?[SEP]For his body would be[SEP]evidence as damning as himself.[EOT]
[SOT]“Nay, sir,” said Johann, “his Highness has thought of that.[SEP]While the[SEP]two hold the outer room, the one who has killed the King unlocks the[SEP]bars in the square window (they turn on a hinge).[SEP]The window now gives[SEP]no light, for its mouth is choked by a great pipe of earthenware; and[SEP]this pipe, which is large enough to let pass through it the body of[SEP]a man, passes into the moat, coming to an end immediately above the[SEP]surface of the water, so that there is no perceptible interval between[SEP]water and pipe.[SEP]The King being dead, his murderer swiftly ties a weight[SEP]to the body, and, dragging it to the window, raises it by a pulley (for,[SEP]lest the weight should prove too great, Detchard has provided one) till[SEP]it is level with the mouth of the pipe.[SEP]He inserts the feet in the pipe,[SEP]and pushes the body down.[SEP]Silently, without splash or sound, it falls[SEP]into the water and thence to the bottom of the moat, which is twenty[SEP]feet deep thereabouts.[SEP]This done, the murderer cries loudly, ‘All’s[SEP]well![SEP]’ and himself slides down the pipe; and the others, if they can and[SEP]the attack is not too hot, run to the inner room and, seeking a moment’s[SEP]delay, bar the door, and in their turn slide down.[SEP]And though the King[SEP]rises not from the bottom, they rise and swim round to the other side,[SEP]where the orders are for men to wait them with ropes, to haul them out,[SEP]and horses.[SEP]And here, if things go ill, the duke will join them and seek[SEP]safety by riding; but if all goes well, they will return to the Castle,[SEP]and have their enemies in a trap.[SEP]That, sir, is the plan of his Highness[SEP]for the disposal of the King in case of need.[SEP]But it is not to be used[SEP]till the last; for, as we all know, he is not minded to kill the King[SEP]unless he can, before or soon after, kill you also, sir.[SEP]Now, sir, I[SEP]have spoken the truth, as God is my witness, and I pray you to shield me[SEP]from the vengeance of Duke Michael; for if, after he knows what I have[SEP]done, I fall into his hands, I shall pray for one thing out of all the[SEP]world--a speedy death, and that I shall not obtain from him![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The fellow’s story was rudely told, but our questions supplemented[SEP]his narrative.[SEP]What he had told us applied to an armed attack; but if[SEP]suspicions were aroused, and there came overwhelming force--such, for[SEP]instance, as I, the King, could bring--the idea of resistance would be[SEP]abandoned; the King would be quietly murdered and slid down the pipe.[SEP]And--here comes an ingenious touch--one of the Six would take his[SEP]place in the cell, and, on the entrance of the searchers, loudly demand[SEP]release and redress; and Michael, being summoned, would confess to hasty[SEP]action, but he would say the man had angered him by seeking the favour[SEP]of a lady in the Castle (this was Antoinette de Mauban) and he had[SEP]confined him there, as he conceived he, as Lord of Zenda, had right to[SEP]do.[SEP]But he was now, on receiving his apology, content to let him go,[SEP]and so end the gossip which, to his Highness’s annoyance, had arisen[SEP]concerning a prisoner in Zenda, and had given his visitors the trouble[SEP]of this enquiry.[SEP]The visitors, baffled, would retire, and Michael could,[SEP]at his leisure, dispose of the body of the King.[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt, Fritz, and I in my bed, looked round on one another in horror and[SEP]bewilderment at the cruelty and cunning of the plan.[SEP]Whether I went[SEP]in peace or in war, openly at the head of a corps, or secretly by a[SEP]stealthy assault, the King would be dead before I could come near him.[SEP]If Michael were stronger and overcame my party, there would be an end.[SEP]But if I were stronger, I should have no way to punish him, no means of[SEP]proving any guilt in him without proving my own guilt also.[SEP]On the other[SEP]hand, I should be left as King (ah![SEP]for a moment my pulse quickened) and[SEP]it would be for the future to witness the final struggle between him and[SEP]me.[SEP]He seemed to have made triumph possible and ruin impossible.[SEP]At[SEP]the worst, he would stand as well as he had stood before I crossed[SEP]his path--with but one man between him and the throne, and that man an[SEP]impostor; at best, there would be none left to stand against him.[SEP]I had[SEP]begun to think that Black Michael was over fond of leaving the fighting[SEP]to his friends; but now I acknowledged that the brains, if not the arms,[SEP]of the conspiracy were his.[EOT]
[SOT]“Does the King know this?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“I and my brother,” answered Johann, “put up the pipe, under the orders[SEP]of my Lord of Hentzau.[SEP]He was on guard that day, and the King asked my[SEP]lord what it meant.[SEP]‘Faith,’ he answered, with his airy laugh, ‘it’s a[SEP]new improvement on the ladder of Jacob, whereby, as you have read, sire,[SEP]men pass from the earth to heaven.[SEP]We thought it not meet that your[SEP]Majesty should go, in case, sire, you must go, by the common route.[SEP]So[SEP]we have made you a pretty private passage where the vulgar cannot stare[SEP]at you or incommode your passage.[SEP]That, sire, is the meaning of[SEP]that pipe.[SEP]’ And he laughed and bowed, and prayed the King’s leave to[SEP]replenish the King’s glass--for the King was at supper.[SEP]And the King,[SEP]though he is a brave man, as are all of his House, grew red and then[SEP]white as he looked on the pipe and at the merry devil who mocked him.[SEP]Ah, sir” (and the fellow shuddered), “it is not easy to sleep quiet in[SEP]the Castle of Zenda, for all of them would as soon cut a man’s throat[SEP]as play a game at cards; and my Lord Rupert would choose it sooner for[SEP]a pastime than any other--ay, sooner than he would ruin a woman, though[SEP]that he loves also.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The man ceased, and I bade Fritz take him away and have him carefully[SEP]guarded; and, turning to him, I added:[EOT]
[SOT]“If anyone asks you if there is a prisoner in Zenda, you may answer[SEP]‘Yes.[SEP]’ But if any asks who the prisoner is, do not answer.[SEP]For all my[SEP]promises will not save you if any man here learns from you the truth as[SEP]to the prisoner of Zenda.[SEP]I’ll kill you like a dog if the thing be so[SEP]much as breathed within the house![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Then, when he was gone, I looked at Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s a hard nut![SEP]” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“So hard,” said he, shaking his grizzled head, “that as I think, this[SEP]time next year is like to find you still King of Ruritania![SEP]” and he[SEP]broke out into curses on Michael’s cunning.[EOT]
[SOT]I lay back on my pillows.[EOT]
[SOT]“There seems to me,” I observed, “to be two ways by which the King can[SEP]come out of Zenda alive.[SEP]One is by treachery in the duke’s followers.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You can leave that out,” said Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“I hope not,” I rejoined, “because the other I was about to mention[SEP]is--by a miracle from heaven![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER 14[EOT]
[SOT]A Night Outside the Castle[EOT]
[SOT]It would have surprised the good people of Ruritania to know of the[SEP]foregoing talk; for, according to the official reports, I had suffered a[SEP]grievous and dangerous hurt from an accidental spear-thrust, received in[SEP]the course of my sport.[SEP]I caused the bulletins to be of a very serious[SEP]character, and created great public excitement, whereby three things[SEP]occurred: first, I gravely offended the medical faculty of Strelsau by[SEP]refusing to summon to my bedside any of them, save a young man, a friend[SEP]of Fritz’s, whom we could trust; secondly, I received word from Marshal[SEP]Strakencz that my orders seemed to have no more weight than his, and[SEP]that the Princess Flavia was leaving for Tarlenheim under his unwilling[SEP]escort (news whereat I strove not to be glad and proud); and thirdly, my[SEP]brother, the Duke of Strelsau, although too well informed to believe the[SEP]account of the origin of my sickness, was yet persuaded by the reports[SEP]and by my seeming inactivity that I was in truth incapable of action,[SEP]and that my life was in some danger.[SEP]This I learnt from the man Johann,[SEP]whom I was compelled to trust and send back to Zenda, where, by the way,[SEP]Rupert Hentzau had him soundly flogged for daring to smirch the morals[SEP]of Zenda by staying out all night in the pursuits of love.[SEP]This, from[SEP]Rupert, Johann deeply resented, and the duke’s approval of it did more[SEP]to bind the keeper to my side than all my promises.[EOT]
[SOT]On Flavia’s arrival I cannot dwell.[SEP]Her joy at finding me up and well,[SEP]instead of on my back and fighting with death, makes a picture that[SEP]even now dances before my eyes till they grow too dim to see it; and her[SEP]reproaches that I had not trusted even her must excuse the means I took[SEP]to quiet them.[SEP]In truth, to have her with me once more was like a taste[SEP]of heaven to a damned soul, the sweeter for the inevitable doom that[SEP]was to follow; and I rejoiced in being able to waste two whole days with[SEP]her.[SEP]And when I had wasted two days, the Duke of Strelsau arranged a[SEP]hunting-party.[EOT]
[SOT]The stroke was near now.[SEP]For Sapt and I, after anxious consultations,[SEP]had resolved that we must risk a blow, our resolution being clinched[SEP]by Johann’s news that the King grew peaked, pale, and ill, and that his[SEP]health was breaking down under his rigorous confinement.[SEP]Now a man--be[SEP]he king or no king--may as well die swiftly and as becomes a gentleman,[SEP]from bullet or thrust, as rot his life out in a cellar![SEP]That thought[SEP]made prompt action advisable in the interests of the King; from my own[SEP]point of view, it grew more and more necessary.[SEP]For Strakencz urged on[SEP]me the need of a speedy marriage, and my own inclinations seconded him[SEP]with such terrible insistence that I feared for my resolution.[SEP]I do not[SEP]believe that I should have done the deed I dreamt of; but I might have[SEP]come to flight, and my flight would have ruined the cause.[SEP]And--yes, I[SEP]am no saint (ask my little sister-in-law), and worse still might have[SEP]happened.[EOT]
[SOT]It is perhaps as strange a thing as has ever been in the history of a[SEP]country that the King’s brother and the King’s personator, in a time of[SEP]profound outward peace, near a placid, undisturbed country town, under[SEP]semblance of amity, should wage a desperate war for the person and life[SEP]of the King.[SEP]Yet such was the struggle that began now between Zenda and[SEP]Tarlenheim.[SEP]When I look back on the time, I seem to myself to have been[SEP]half mad.[SEP]Sapt has told me that I suffered no interference and listened[SEP]to no remonstrances; and if ever a King of Ruritania ruled like a[SEP]despot, I was, in those days, the man.[SEP]Look where I would, I saw nothing[SEP]that made life sweet to me, and I took my life in my hand and carried it[SEP]carelessly as a man dangles an old glove.[SEP]At first they strove to guard[SEP]me, to keep me safe, to persuade me not to expose myself; but when they[SEP]saw how I was set, there grew up among them--whether they knew the truth[SEP]or not--a feeling that Fate ruled the issue, and that I must be left to[SEP]play my game with Michael my own way.[EOT]
[SOT]Late next night I rose from table, where Flavia had sat by me, and[SEP]conducted her to the door of her apartments.[SEP]There I kissed her hand,[SEP]and bade her sleep sound and wake to happy days.[SEP]Then I changed my[SEP]clothes and went out.[SEP]Sapt and Fritz were waiting for me with six men[SEP]and the horses.[SEP]Over his saddle Sapt carried a long coil of rope, and[SEP]both were heavily armed.[SEP]I had with me a short stout cudgel and a long[SEP]knife.[SEP]Making a circuit, we avoided the town, and in an hour found[SEP]ourselves slowly mounting the hill that led to the Castle of Zenda.[SEP]The[SEP]night was dark and very stormy; gusts of wind and spits of rain caught[SEP]us as we breasted the incline, and the great trees moaned and sighed.[SEP]When we came to a thick clump, about a quarter of a mile from the[SEP]Castle, we bade our six friends hide there with the horses.[SEP]Sapt had a[SEP]whistle, and they could rejoin us in a few moments if danger came: but,[SEP]up to now, we had met no one.[SEP]I hoped that Michael was still off his[SEP]guard, believing me to be safe in bed.[SEP]However that might be, we gained[SEP]the top of the hill without accident, and found ourselves on the edge of[SEP]the moat where it sweeps under the road, separating the Old Castle[SEP]from it.[SEP]A tree stood on the edge of the bank, and Sapt, silently and[SEP]diligently, set to make fast the rope.[SEP]I stripped off my boots, took a[SEP]pull at a flask of brandy, loosened the knife in its sheath, and took[SEP]the cudgel between my teeth.[SEP]Then I shook hands with my friends, not[SEP]heeding a last look of entreaty from Fritz, and laid hold of the rope.[SEP]I[SEP]was going to have a look at “Jacob’s Ladder.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Gently I lowered myself into the water.[SEP]Though the night was wild, the[SEP]day had been warm and bright, and the water was not cold.[SEP]I struck out,[SEP]and began to swim round the great walls which frowned above me.[SEP]I could[SEP]see only three yards ahead; I had then good hopes of not being seen,[SEP]as I crept along close under the damp, moss-grown masonry.[SEP]There were[SEP]lights from the new part of the Castle on the other side, and now and[SEP]again I heard laughter and merry shouts.[SEP]I fancied I recognized young[SEP]Rupert Hentzau’s ringing tones, and pictured him flushed with wine.[SEP]Recalling my thoughts to the business in hand, I rested a moment.[SEP]If[SEP]Johann’s description were right, I must be near the window now.[SEP]Very[SEP]slowly I moved; and out of the darkness ahead loomed a shape.[SEP]It was[SEP]the pipe, curving from the window to the water: about four feet of its[SEP]surface were displayed; it was as big round as two men.[SEP]I was about to[SEP]approach it, when I saw something else, and my heart stood still.[SEP]The nose of a boat protruded beyond the pipe on the other side; and[SEP]listening intently, I heard a slight shuffle--as of a man shifting his[SEP]position.[SEP]Who was the man who guarded Michael’s invention?[SEP]Was he awake[SEP]or was he asleep?[SEP]I felt if my knife were ready, and trod water; as[SEP]I did so, I found bottom under my feet.[SEP]The foundations of the Castle[SEP]extended some fifteen inches, making a ledge; and I stood on it, out of[SEP]water from my armpits upwards.[SEP]Then I crouched and peered through the[SEP]darkness under the pipe, where, curving, it left a space.[EOT]
[SOT]There was a man in the boat.[SEP]A rifle lay by him--I saw the gleam of[SEP]the barrel.[SEP]Here was the sentinel![SEP]He sat very still.[SEP]I listened; he[SEP]breathed heavily, regularly, monotonously.[SEP]By heaven, he slept![SEP]Kneeling[SEP]on the shelf, I drew forward under the pipe till my face was within two[SEP]feet of his.[SEP]He was a big man, I saw.[SEP]It was Max Holf, the brother of[SEP]Johann.[SEP]My hand stole to my belt, and I drew out my knife.[SEP]Of all the[SEP]deeds of my life, I love the least to think of this, and whether it were[SEP]the act of a man or a traitor I will not ask.[SEP]I said to myself: “It is[SEP]war--and the King’s life is the stake.[SEP]” And I raised myself from beneath[SEP]the pipe and stood up by the boat, which lay moored by the ledge.[SEP]Holding my breath, I marked the spot and raised my arm.[SEP]The great fellow[SEP]stirred.[SEP]He opened his eyes--wide, wider.[SEP]He gasped in terror at my[SEP]face and clutched at his rifle.[SEP]I struck home.[SEP]And I heard the chorus of[SEP]a love-song from the opposite bank.[EOT]
[SOT]Leaving him where he lay, a huddled mass, I turned to “Jacob’s Ladder.[SEP]”[SEP]My time was short.[SEP]This fellow’s turn of watching might be over[SEP]directly, and relief would come.[SEP]Leaning over the pipe, I examined it,[SEP]from the end near the water to the topmost extremity where it passed, or[SEP]seemed to pass, through the masonry of the wall.[SEP]There was no break[SEP]in it, no chink.[SEP]Dropping on my knees, I tested the under side.[SEP]And[SEP]my breath went quick and fast, for on this lower side, where the pipe[SEP]should have clung close to the masonry, there was a gleam of light![SEP]That[SEP]light must come from the cell of the King![SEP]I set my shoulder against the[SEP]pipe and exerted my strength.[SEP]The chink widened a very, very little,[SEP]and hastily I desisted; I had done enough to show that the pipe was not[SEP]fixed in the masonry at the lower side.[EOT]
[SOT]Then I heard a voice--a harsh, grating voice:[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, sire, if you have had enough of my society, I will leave you to[SEP]repose; but I must fasten the little ornaments first.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]It was Detchard![SEP]I caught the English accent in a moment.[EOT]
[SOT]“Have you anything to ask, sire, before we part?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The King’s voice followed.[SEP]It was his, though it was faint and[SEP]hollow--different from the merry tones I had heard in the glades of the[SEP]forest.[EOT]
[SOT]“Pray my brother,” said the King, “to kill me.[SEP]I am dying by inches[SEP]here.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The duke does not desire your death, sire--yet,” sneered Detchard;[SEP]“when he does behold your path to heaven![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The King answered:[EOT]
[SOT]“So be it![SEP]And now, if your orders allow it, pray leave me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“May you dream of paradise![SEP]” said the ruffian.[EOT]
[SOT]The light disappeared.[SEP]I heard the bolts of the door run home.[SEP]And then[SEP]I heard the sobs of the King.[SEP]He was alone, as he thought.[SEP]Who dares[SEP]mock at him?[EOT]
[SOT]I did not venture to speak to him.[SEP]The risk of some exclamation escaping[SEP]him in surprise was too great.[SEP]I dared do nothing that night; and my[SEP]task now was to get myself away in safety, and to carry off the carcass[SEP]of the dead man.[SEP]To leave him there would tell too much.[SEP]Casting loose[SEP]the boat, I got in.[SEP]The wind was blowing a gale now, and there was[SEP]little danger of oars being heard.[SEP]I rowed swiftly round to where my[SEP]friends waited.[SEP]I had just reached the spot, when a loud whistle sounded[SEP]over the moat behind me.[EOT]
[SOT]“Hullo, Max![SEP]” I heard shouted.[EOT]
[SOT]I hailed Sapt in a low tone.[SEP]The rope came down.[SEP]I tied it round the[SEP]corpse, and then went up it myself.[EOT]
[SOT]“Whistle you too,” I whispered, “for our men, and haul in the line.[SEP]No[SEP]talk now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]They hauled up the body.[SEP]Just as it reached the road, three men on[SEP]horseback swept round from the front of the Castle.[SEP]We saw them; but,[SEP]being on foot ourselves, we escaped their notice.[SEP]But we heard our men[SEP]coming up with a shout.[EOT]
[SOT]“The devil, but it’s dark![SEP]” cried a ringing voice.[EOT]
[SOT]It was young Rupert.[SEP]A moment later, shots rang out.[SEP]Our people had met[SEP]them.[SEP]I started forward at a run, Sapt and Fritz following me.[EOT]
[SOT]“Thrust, thrust![SEP]” cried Rupert again, and a loud groan following told[SEP]that he himself was not behind-hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m done, Rupert![SEP]” cried a voice.[SEP]“They’re three to one.[SEP]Save[SEP]yourself![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I ran on, holding my cudgel in my hand.[SEP]Suddenly a horse came towards[SEP]me.[SEP]A man was on it, leaning over his shoulder.[EOT]
[SOT]“Are you cooked too, Krafstein?[SEP]” he cried.[EOT]
[SOT]There was no answer.[EOT]
[SOT]I sprang to the horse’s head.[SEP]It was Rupert Hentzau.[EOT]
[SOT]“At last![SEP]” I cried.[EOT]
[SOT]For we seemed to have him.[SEP]He had only his sword in his hand.[SEP]My men[SEP]were hot upon him; Sapt and Fritz were running up.[SEP]I had outstripped[SEP]them; but if they got close enough to fire, he must die or surrender.[EOT]
[SOT]“At last![SEP]” I cried.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s the play-actor![SEP]” cried he, slashing at my cudgel.[SEP]He cut it clean[SEP]in two; and, judging discretion better than death, I ducked my head[SEP]and (I blush to tell it) scampered for my life.[SEP]The devil was in Rupert[SEP]Hentzau; for he put spurs to his horse, and I, turning to look, saw him[SEP]ride, full gallop, to the edge of the moat and leap in, while the shots[SEP]of our party fell thick round him like hail.[SEP]With one gleam of moonlight[SEP]we should have riddled him with balls; but, in the darkness, he won to[SEP]the corner of the Castle, and vanished from our sight.[EOT]
[SOT]“The deuce take him![SEP]” grinned Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s a pity,” said I, “that he’s a villain.[SEP]Whom have we got?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]We had Lauengram and Krafstein: they lay dead; and, concealment being[SEP]no longer possible, we flung them, with Max, into the moat; and, drawing[SEP]together in a compact body, rode off down the hill.[SEP]And, in our midst,[SEP]went the bodies of three gallant gentlemen.[SEP]Thus we travelled home,[SEP]heavy at heart for the death of our friends, sore uneasy concerning[SEP]the King, and cut to the quick that young Rupert had played yet another[SEP]winning hand with us.[EOT]
[SOT]For my own part, I was vexed and angry that I had killed no man in open[SEP]fight, but only stabbed a knave in his sleep.[SEP]And I did not love to hear[SEP]Rupert call me a play-actor.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER 15[EOT]
[SOT]I Talk with a Tempter[EOT]
[SOT]Ruritania is not England, or the quarrel between Duke Michael and myself[SEP]could not have gone on, with the extraordinary incidents which marked[SEP]it, without more public notice being directed to it.[SEP]Duels were frequent[SEP]among all the upper classes, and private quarrels between great men[SEP]kept the old habit of spreading to their friends and dependents.[SEP]Nevertheless, after the affray which I have just related, such reports[SEP]began to circulate that I felt it necessary to be on my guard.[SEP]The death[SEP]of the gentlemen involved could not be hidden from their relatives.[SEP]I[SEP]issued a stern order, declaring that duelling had attained unprecedented[SEP]licence (the Chancellor drew up the document for me, and very well he[SEP]did it), and forbidding it save in the gravest cases.[SEP]I sent a public[SEP]and stately apology to Michael, and he returned a deferential and[SEP]courteous reply to me; for our one point of union was--and it underlay[SEP]all our differences and induced an unwilling harmony between our[SEP]actions--that we could neither of us afford to throw our cards on the[SEP]table.[SEP]He, as well as I, was a “play-actor”, and, hating one another, we[SEP]combined to dupe public opinion.[SEP]Unfortunately, however, the necessity[SEP]for concealment involved the necessity of delay: the King might die[SEP]in his prison, or even be spirited off somewhere else; it could not be[SEP]helped.[SEP]For a little while I was compelled to observe a truce, and[SEP]my only consolation was that Flavia most warmly approved of my edict[SEP]against duelling, and, when I expressed delight at having won her[SEP]favour, prayed me, if her favour were any motive to me, to prohibit the[SEP]practice altogether.[EOT]
[SOT]“Wait till we are married,” said I, smiling.[EOT]
[SOT]Not the least peculiar result of the truce and of the secrecy which[SEP]dictated it was that the town of Zenda became in the day-time--I would[SEP]not have trusted far to its protection by night--a sort of neutral zone,[SEP]where both parties could safely go; and I, riding down one day with[SEP]Flavia and Sapt, had an encounter with an acquaintance, which presented[SEP]a ludicrous side, but was at the same time embarrassing.[SEP]As I rode[SEP]along, I met a dignified looking person driving in a two-horsed[SEP]carriage.[SEP]He stopped his horses, got out, and approached me, bowing low.[SEP]I recognized the Head of the Strelsau Police.[EOT]
[SOT]“Your Majesty’s ordinance as to duelling is receiving our best[SEP]attention,” he assured me.[EOT]
[SOT]If the best attention involved his presence in Zenda, I determined at[SEP]once to dispense with it.[EOT]
[SOT]“Is that what brings you to Zenda, Prefect?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why no, sire; I am here because I desired to oblige the British[SEP]Ambassador.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What’s the British Ambassador doing _dans cette galère_?[SEP]” said I,[SEP]carelessly.[EOT]
[SOT]“A young countryman of his, sire--a man of some position--is missing.[SEP]His friends have not heard from him for two months, and there is reason[SEP]to believe that he was last seen in Zenda.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Flavia was paying little attention.[SEP]I dared not look at Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“What reason?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“A friend of his in Paris--a certain M.[SEP]Featherly--has given us[SEP]information which makes it possible that he came here, and the officials[SEP]of the railway recollect his name on some luggage.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What was his name?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Rassendyll, sire,” he answered; and I saw that the name meant nothing[SEP]to him.[SEP]But, glancing at Flavia, he lowered his voice, as he went on:[SEP]“It is thought that he may have followed a lady here.[SEP]Has your Majesty[SEP]heard of a certain Madame de Mauban?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Why, yes,” said I, my eye involuntarily travelling towards the Castle.[EOT]
[SOT]“She arrived in Ruritania about the same time as this Rassendyll.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I caught the Prefect’s glance; he was regarding me with enquiry writ[SEP]large on his face.[EOT]
[SOT]“Sapt,” said I, “I must speak a word to the Prefect.[SEP]Will you ride on[SEP]a few paces with the princess?[SEP]” And I added to the Prefect: “Come, sir,[SEP]what do you mean?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He drew close to me, and I bent in the saddle.[EOT]
[SOT]“If he were in love with the lady?[SEP]” he whispered.[SEP]“Nothing has been[SEP]heard of him for two months;” and this time it was the eye of the[SEP]Prefect which travelled towards the Castle.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, the lady is there,” I said quietly.[SEP]“But I don’t suppose Mr.[SEP]Rassendyll--is that the name?[SEP]--is.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The duke,” he whispered, “does not like rivals, sire.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You’re right there,” said I, with all sincerity.[SEP]“But surely you hint[SEP]at a very grave charge?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He spread his hands out in apology.[SEP]I whispered in his ear:[EOT]
[SOT]“This is a grave matter.[SEP]Go back to Strelsau--”[EOT]
[SOT]“But, sire, if I have a clue here?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Go back to Strelsau,” I repeated.[SEP]“Tell the Ambassador that you have a[SEP]clue, but that you must be left alone for a week or two.[SEP]Meanwhile, I’ll[SEP]charge myself with looking into the matter.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“The Ambassador is very pressing, sir.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You must quiet him.[SEP]Come, sir; you see that if your suspicions are[SEP]correct, it is an affair in which we must move with caution.[SEP]We can have[SEP]no scandal.[SEP]Mind you return tonight.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He promised to obey me, and I rode on to rejoin my companions, a little[SEP]easier in my mind.[SEP]Enquiries after me must be stopped at all hazards for[SEP]a week or two; and this clever official had come surprisingly near the[SEP]truth.[SEP]His impression might be useful some day, but if he acted on it[SEP]now it might mean the worse to the King.[SEP]Heartily did I curse George[SEP]Featherly for not holding his tongue.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well,” asked Flavia, “have you finished your business?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Most satisfactorily,” said I.[SEP]“Come, shall we turn round?[SEP]We are almost[SEP]trenching on my brother’s territory.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]We were, in fact, at the extreme end of the town, just where the hills[SEP]begin to mount towards the Castle.[SEP]We cast our eyes up, admiring the[SEP]massive beauty of the old walls, and we saw a _cortège_ winding slowly[SEP]down the hill.[SEP]On it came.[EOT]
[SOT]“Let us go back,” said Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]“I should like to stay,” said Flavia; and I reined my horse beside hers.[EOT]
[SOT]We could distinguish the approaching party now.[SEP]There came first two[SEP]mounted servants in black uniforms, relieved only by a silver badge.[SEP]These were followed by a car drawn by four horses: on it, under a[SEP]heavy pall, lay a coffin; behind it rode a man in plain black clothes,[SEP]carrying his hat in his hand.[SEP]Sapt uncovered, and we stood waiting,[SEP]Flavia keeping by me and laying her hand on my arm.[EOT]
[SOT]“It is one of the gentlemen killed in the quarrel, I expect,” she said.[EOT]
[SOT]I beckoned to a groom.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ride and ask whom they escort,” I ordered.[EOT]
[SOT]He rode up to the servants, and I saw him pass on to the gentleman who[SEP]rode behind.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s Rupert of Hentzau,” whispered Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]Rupert it was, and directly afterwards, waving to the procession to[SEP]stand still, Rupert trotted up to me.[SEP]He was in a frock-coat, tightly[SEP]buttoned, and trousers.[SEP]He wore an aspect of sadness, and he bowed with[SEP]profound respect.[SEP]Yet suddenly he smiled, and I smiled too, for old[SEP]Sapt’s hand lay in his left breast-pocket, and Rupert and I both guessed[SEP]what lay in the hand inside the pocket.[EOT]
[SOT]“Your Majesty asks whom we escort,” said Rupert.[SEP]“It is my dear friend,[SEP]Albert of Lauengram.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Sir,” said I, “no one regrets the unfortunate affair more than I.[SEP]My[SEP]ordinance, which I mean to have obeyed, is witness to it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Poor fellow![SEP]” said Flavia softly, and I saw Rupert’s eyes flash at her.[SEP]Whereat I grew red; for, if I had my way, Rupert Hentzau should not[SEP]have defiled her by so much as a glance.[SEP]Yet he did it and dared to let[SEP]admiration be seen in his look.[EOT]
[SOT]“Your Majesty’s words are gracious,” he said.[SEP]“I grieve for my friend.[SEP]Yet, sire, others must soon lie as he lies now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It is a thing we all do well to remember, my lord,” I rejoined.[EOT]
[SOT]“Even kings, sire,” said Rupert, in a moralizing tone; and old Sapt[SEP]swore softly by my side.[EOT]
[SOT]“It is true,” said I.[SEP]“How fares my brother, my lord?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He is better, sire.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I am rejoiced.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He hopes soon to leave for Strelsau, when his health is secured.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He is only convalescent then?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“There remain one or two small troubles,” answered the insolent fellow,[SEP]in the mildest tone in the world.[EOT]
[SOT]“Express my earnest hope,” said Flavia, “that they may soon cease to[SEP]trouble him.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Your Royal Highness’s wish is, humbly, my own,” said Rupert, with a[SEP]bold glance that brought a blush to Flavia’s cheek.[EOT]
[SOT]I bowed; and Rupert, bowing lower, backed his horse and signed to his[SEP]party to proceed.[SEP]With a sudden impulse, I rode after him.[SEP]He turned[SEP]swiftly, fearing that, even in the presence of the dead and before a[SEP]lady’s eyes, I meant him mischief.[EOT]
[SOT]“You fought as a brave man the other night,” I said.[SEP]“Come, you are[SEP]young, sir.[SEP]If you will deliver your prisoner alive to me, you shall[SEP]come to no hurt.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He looked at me with a mocking smile; but suddenly he rode nearer to me.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m unarmed,” he said; “and our old Sapt there could pick me off in a[SEP]minute.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’m not afraid,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“No, curse you![SEP]” he answered.[SEP]“Look here, I made you a proposal from the[SEP]duke once.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ll hear nothing from Black Michael,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then hear one from me.[SEP]” He lowered his voice to a whisper.[SEP]“Attack the[SEP]Castle boldly.[SEP]Let Sapt and Tarlenheim lead.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Go on,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“Arrange the time with me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I have such confidence in you, my lord![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Tut![SEP]I’m talking business now.[SEP]Sapt there and Fritz will fall; Black[SEP]Michael will fall--”[EOT]
[SOT]“--Black Michael will fall, like the dog he is; the prisoner, as you[SEP]call him, will go by ‘Jacob’s Ladder’--ah, you know that![SEP]--to hell![SEP]Two[SEP]men will be left--I, Rupert Hentzau, and you, the King of Ruritania.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He paused, and then, in a voice that quivered with eagerness, added:[EOT]
[SOT]“Isn’t that a hand to play?[SEP]--a throne and your princess![SEP]And for me, say[SEP]a competence and your Majesty’s gratitude.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Surely,” I exclaimed, “while you’re above ground, hell wants its[SEP]master![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, think it over,” he said.[SEP]“And, look you, it would take more than[SEP]a scruple or two to keep me from yonder girl,” and his evil eye flashed[SEP]again at her I loved.[EOT]
[SOT]“Get out of my reach![SEP]” said I; and yet in a moment I began to laugh for[SEP]the very audacity of it.[EOT]
[SOT]“Would you turn against your master?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]He swore at Michael for being what the offspring of a legal, though[SEP]morganatic, union should not be called, and said to me in an almost[SEP]confidential and apparently friendly tone:[EOT]
[SOT]“He gets in my way, you know.[SEP]He’s a jealous brute![SEP]Faith, I nearly[SEP]stuck a knife into him last night; he came most cursedly _mal àpropos_![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]My temper was well under control now; I was learning something.[EOT]
[SOT]“A lady?[SEP]” I asked negligently.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, and a beauty,” he nodded.[SEP]“But you’ve seen her.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah![SEP]was it at a tea-party, when some of your friends got on the wrong[SEP]side of the table?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What can you expect of fools like Detchard and De Gautet?[SEP]I wish I’d[SEP]been there.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And the duke interferes?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well,” said Rupert meditatively, “that’s hardly a fair way of putting[SEP]it, perhaps.[SEP]I want to interfere.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And she prefers the duke?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, the silly creature![SEP]Ah, well, you think about my plan,” and, with a[SEP]bow, he pricked his horse and trotted after the body of his friend.[EOT]
[SOT]I went back to Flavia and Sapt, pondering on the strangeness of the man.[SEP]Wicked men I have known in plenty, but Rupert Hentzau remains unique in[SEP]my experience.[SEP]And if there be another anywhere, let him be caught and[SEP]hanged out of hand.[SEP]So say I![EOT]
[SOT]“He’s very handsome, isn’t he?[SEP]” said Flavia.[EOT]
[SOT]Well, of course, she didn’t know him as I did; yet I was put out, for I[SEP]thought his bold glances would have made her angry.[SEP]But my dear Flavia[SEP]was a woman, and so--she was not put out.[SEP]On the contrary, she thought[SEP]young Rupert very handsome--as, beyond question, the ruffian was.[EOT]
[SOT]“And how sad he looked at his friend’s death![SEP]” said she.[EOT]
[SOT]“He’ll have better reason to be sad at his own,” observed Sapt, with a[SEP]grim smile.[EOT]
[SOT]As for me, I grew sulky; unreasonable it was perhaps, for what better[SEP]business had I to look at her with love than had even Rupert’s lustful[SEP]eyes?[SEP]And sulky I remained till, as evening fell and we rode up to[SEP]Tarlenheim, Sapt having fallen behind in case anyone should be[SEP]following us, Flavia, riding close beside me, said softly, with a little[SEP]half-ashamed laugh:[EOT]
[SOT]“Unless you smile, Rudolf, I cry.[SEP]Why are you angry?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It was something that fellow said to me,” said I, but I was smiling as[SEP]we reached the door and dismounted.[EOT]
[SOT]There a servant handed me a note: it was unaddressed.[EOT]
[SOT]“Is it for me?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, sire; a boy brought it.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I tore it open:[EOT]
[SOT]Johann carries this for me.[SEP]I warned you once.[SEP]In the name of God, and[SEP]if you are a man, rescue me from this den of murderers![SEP]--A.[SEP]de M.[EOT]
[SOT]I handed it to Sapt; but all that the tough old soul said in reply to[SEP]this piteous appeal was:[EOT]
[SOT]“Whose fault brought her there?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Nevertheless, not being faultless myself, I took leave to pity[SEP]Antoinette de Mauban.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER 16[EOT]
[SOT]A Desperate Plan[EOT]
[SOT]As I had ridden publicly in Zenda, and had talked there with Rupert[SEP]Hentzau, of course all pretence of illness was at an end.[SEP]I marked the[SEP]effect on the garrison of Zenda: they ceased to be seen abroad; and any[SEP]of my men who went near the Castle reported that the utmost vigilance[SEP]prevailed there.[SEP]Touched as I was by Madame de Mauban’s appeal, I seemed[SEP]as powerless to befriend her as I had proved to help the King.[SEP]Michael[SEP]bade me defiance; and although he too had been seen outside the walls,[SEP]with more disregard for appearances than he had hitherto shown, he did[SEP]not take the trouble to send any excuse for his failure to wait on the[SEP]King.[SEP]Time ran on in inactivity, when every moment was pressing; for[SEP]not only was I faced with the new danger which the stir about my[SEP]disappearance brought on me, but great murmurs had arisen in Strelsau at[SEP]my continued absence from the city.[SEP]They had been greater, but for the[SEP]knowledge that Flavia was with me; and for this reason I suffered her to[SEP]stay, though I hated to have her where danger was, and though every[SEP]day of our present sweet intercourse strained my endurance almost to[SEP]breaking.[SEP]As a final blow, nothing would content my advisers, Strakencz[SEP]and the Chancellor (who came out from Strelsau to make an urgent[SEP]representation to me), save that I should appoint a day for the public[SEP]solemnization of my betrothal, a ceremony which in Ruritania is well[SEP]nigh as binding and great a thing as the marriage itself.[SEP]And this--with[SEP]Flavia sitting by me--I was forced to do, setting a date a fortnight[SEP]ahead, and appointing the Cathedral in Strelsau as the place.[SEP]And this[SEP]formal act being published far and wide, caused great joy throughout the[SEP]kingdom, and was the talk of all tongues; so that I reckoned there were[SEP]but two men who chafed at it--I mean Black Michael and myself; and but[SEP]one who did not know of it--that one the man whose name I bore, the King[SEP]of Ruritania.[EOT]
[SOT]In truth, I heard something of the way the news was received in the[SEP]Castle; for after an interval of three days, the man Johann, greedy for[SEP]more money, though fearful for his life, again found means to visit us.[SEP]He had been waiting on the duke when the tidings came.[SEP]Black Michael’s[SEP]face had grown blacker still, and he had sworn savagely; nor was he[SEP]better pleased when young Rupert took oath that I meant to do as I[SEP]said, and turning to Madame de Mauban, wished her joy on a rival gone.[SEP]Michael’s hand stole towards his sword (said Johann), but not a bit did[SEP]Rupert care; for he rallied the duke on having made a better King than[SEP]had reigned for years past in Ruritania.[SEP]“And,” said he, with a meaning[SEP]bow to his exasperated master, “the devil sends the princess a finer man[SEP]than heaven had marked out for her, by my soul, it does![SEP]” Then Michael[SEP]harshly bade him hold his tongue, and leave them; but Rupert must needs[SEP]first kiss madame’s hand, which he did as though he loved her, while[SEP]Michael glared at him.[EOT]
[SOT]This was the lighter side of the fellow’s news; but more serious came[SEP]behind, and it was plain that if time pressed at Tarlenheim, it pressed[SEP]none the less fiercely at Zenda.[SEP]For the King was very sick: Johann had[SEP]seen him, and he was wasted and hardly able to move.[SEP]“There could be no[SEP]thought of taking another for him now.[SEP]” So alarmed were they, that they[SEP]had sent for a physician from Strelsau; and the physician having been[SEP]introduced into the King’s cell, had come forth pale and trembling, and[SEP]urgently prayed the duke to let him go back and meddle no more in the[SEP]affair; but the duke would not, and held him there a prisoner, telling[SEP]him his life was safe if the King lived while the duke desired and died[SEP]when the duke desired--not otherwise.[SEP]And, persuaded by the physician,[SEP]they had allowed Madame de Mauban to visit the King and give him such[SEP]attendance as his state needed, and as only a woman can give.[SEP]Yet his[SEP]life hung in the balance; and I was still strong and whole and free.[SEP]Wherefore great gloom reigned at Zenda; and save when they quarrelled,[SEP]to which they were very prone, they hardly spoke.[SEP]But the deeper the[SEP]depression of the rest, young Rupert went about Satan’s work with a[SEP]smile in his eye and a song on his lip; and laughed “fit to burst” (said[SEP]Johann) because the duke always set Detchard to guard the King when[SEP]Madame de Mauban was in the cell--which precaution was, indeed, not[SEP]unwise in my careful brother.[SEP]Thus Johann told his tale and seized his[SEP]crowns.[SEP]Yet he besought us to allow him to stay with us in Tarlenheim,[SEP]and not venture his head again in the lion’s den; but we had need of him[SEP]there, and, although I refused to constrain him, I prevailed on him by[SEP]increased rewards to go back and carry tidings to Madame de Mauban that[SEP]I was working for her, and that, if she could, she should speak one[SEP]word of comfort to the King.[SEP]For while suspense is bad for the sick, yet[SEP]despair is worse still, and it might be that the King lay dying of mere[SEP]hopelessness, for I could learn of no definite disease that afflicted[SEP]him.[EOT]
[SOT]“And how do they guard the King now?[SEP]” I asked, remembering that two of[SEP]the Six were dead, and Max Holf also.[EOT]
[SOT]“Detchard and Bersonin watch by night, Rupert Hentzau and De Gautet by[SEP]day, sir,” he answered.[EOT]
[SOT]“Only two at a time?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, sir; but the others rest in a room just above, and are within sound[SEP]of a cry or a whistle.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“A room just above?[SEP]I didn’t know of that.[SEP]Is there any communication[SEP]between it and the room where they watch?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No, sir.[SEP]You must go down a few stairs and through the door by the[SEP]drawbridge, and so to where the King is lodged.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And that door is locked?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Only the four lords have keys, sir.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I drew nearer to him.[EOT]
[SOT]“And have they keys of the grating?[SEP]” I asked in a low whisper.[EOT]
[SOT]“I think, sir, only Detchard and Rupert.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Where does the duke lodge?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“In the chateau, on the first floor.[SEP]His apartments are on the right as[SEP]you go towards the drawbridge.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And Madame de Mauban?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Just opposite, on the left.[SEP]But her door is locked after she has[SEP]entered.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“To keep her in?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Doubtless, sir.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Perhaps for another reason?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It is possible.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And the duke, I suppose, has the key?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes.[SEP]And the drawbridge is drawn back at night, and of that, too, the[SEP]duke holds the key, so that it cannot be run across the moat without[SEP]application to him.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And where do you sleep?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“In the entrance hall of the chateau, with five servants.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“They have pikes, sir, but no firearms.[SEP]The duke will not trust them[SEP]with firearms.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Then at last I took the matter boldly in my hands.[SEP]I had failed once at[SEP]“Jacob’s Ladder;” I should fail again there.[SEP]I must make the attack from[SEP]the other side.[EOT]
[SOT]“I have promised you twenty thousand crowns,” said I.[SEP]“You shall have[SEP]fifty thousand if you will do what I ask of you tomorrow night.[SEP]But,[SEP]first, do those servants know who your prisoner is?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No, sir.[SEP]They believe him to be some private enemy of the duke’s.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And they would not doubt that I am the King?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“How should they?[SEP]” he asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Look to this, then.[SEP]Tomorrow, at two in the morning exactly, fling open[SEP]the front door of the chateau.[SEP]Don’t fail by an instant.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Shall you be there, sir?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ask no questions.[SEP]Do what I tell you.[SEP]Say the hall is close, or what[SEP]you will.[SEP]That is all I ask of you.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And may I escape by the door, sir, when I have opened it?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, as quick as your legs will carry you.[SEP]One thing more.[SEP]Carry this[SEP]note to madame--oh, it’s in French, you can’t read it--and charge her,[SEP]for the sake of all our lives, not to fail in what it orders.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The man was trembling but I had to trust to what he had of courage and[SEP]to what he had of honesty.[SEP]I dared not wait, for I feared that the King[SEP]would die.[EOT]
[SOT]When the fellow was gone, I called Sapt and Fritz to me, and unfolded[SEP]the plan that I had formed.[SEP]Sapt shook his head over it.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why can’t you wait?[SEP]” he asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“The King may die.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Michael will be forced to act before that.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Then,” said I, “the King may live.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, and if he does?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“For a fortnight?[SEP]” I asked simply.[EOT]
[SOT]And Sapt bit his moustache.[EOT]
[SOT]Suddenly Fritz von Tarlenheim laid his hand on my shoulder.[EOT]
[SOT]“Let us go and make the attempt,” said he.[EOT]
[SOT]“I mean you to go--don’t be afraid,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, but do you stay here, and take care of the princess.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]A gleam came into old Sapt’s eye.[EOT]
[SOT]“We should have Michael one way or the other then,” he chuckled;[SEP]“whereas if you go and are killed with the King, what will become of[SEP]those of us who are left?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“They will serve Queen Flavia,” said I, “and I would to God I could be[SEP]one of them.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]A pause followed.[SEP]Old Sapt broke it by saying sadly, yet with an unmeant[SEP]drollery that set Fritz and me laughing:[EOT]
[SOT]“Why didn’t old Rudolf the Third marry your--great-grandmother, was it?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Come,” said I, “it is the King we are thinking about.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It is true,” said Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]“Moreover,” I went on, “I have been an impostor for the profit of[SEP]another, but I will not be one for my own; and if the King is not alive[SEP]and on his throne before the day of betrothal comes, I will tell the[SEP]truth, come what may.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You shall go, lad,” said Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]Here is the plan I had made.[SEP]A strong party under Sapt’s command was[SEP]to steal up to the door of the chateau.[SEP]If discovered prematurely, they[SEP]were to kill anyone who found them--with their swords, for I wanted no[SEP]noise of firing.[SEP]If all went well, they would be at the door when Johann[SEP]opened it.[SEP]They were to rush in and secure the servants if their mere[SEP]presence and the use of the King’s name were not enough.[SEP]At the same[SEP]moment--and on this hinged the plan--a woman’s cry was to ring out loud[SEP]and shrill from Antoinette de Mauban’s chamber.[SEP]Again and again she was[SEP]to cry: “Help, help![SEP]Michael, help![SEP]” and then to utter the name of young[SEP]Rupert Hentzau.[SEP]Then, as we hoped, Michael, in fury, would rush out of[SEP]his apartments opposite, and fall alive into the hands of Sapt.[SEP]Still[SEP]the cries would go on; and my men would let down the drawbridge; and it[SEP]would be strange if Rupert, hearing his name thus taken in vain, did not[SEP]descend from where he slept and seek to cross.[SEP]De Gautet might or might[SEP]not come with him: that must be left to chance.[EOT]
[SOT]And when Rupert set his foot on the drawbridge?[SEP]There was my part: for I[SEP]was minded for another swim in the moat; and, lest I should grow weary,[SEP]I had resolved to take with me a small wooden ladder, on which I could[SEP]rest my arms in the water--and my feet when I left it.[SEP]I would rear it[SEP]against the wall just by the bridge; and when the bridge was across, I[SEP]would stealthily creep on to it--and then if Rupert or De Gautet crossed[SEP]in safety, it would be my misfortune, not my fault.[SEP]They dead, two men[SEP]only would remain; and for them we must trust to the confusion we had[SEP]created and to a sudden rush.[SEP]We should have the keys of the door that[SEP]led to the all-important rooms.[SEP]Perhaps they would rush out.[SEP]If they[SEP]stood by their orders, then the King’s life hung on the swiftness with[SEP]which we could force the outer door; and I thanked God that not Rupert[SEP]Hentzau watched, but Detchard.[SEP]For though Detchard was a cool man,[SEP]relentless, and no coward, he had neither the dash nor the recklessness[SEP]of Rupert.[SEP]Moreover, he, if any one of them, really loved Black Michael,[SEP]and it might be that he would leave Bersonin to guard the King, and rush[SEP]across the bridge to take part in the affray on the other side.[EOT]
[SOT]So I planned--desperately.[SEP]And, that our enemy might be the better[SEP]lulled to security, I gave orders that our residence should be[SEP]brilliantly lighted from top to bottom, as though we were engaged in[SEP]revelry; and should so be kept all night, with music playing and people[SEP]moving to and fro.[SEP]Strakencz would be there, and he was to conceal our[SEP]departure, if he could, from Flavia.[SEP]And if we came not again by the[SEP]morning, he was to march, openly and in force to the Castle, and demand[SEP]the person of the King; if Black Michael were not there, as I did not[SEP]think he would be, the Marshal would take Flavia with him, as swiftly as[SEP]he could, to Strelsau, and there proclaim Black Michael’s treachery and[SEP]the probable death of the King, and rally all that there was honest and[SEP]true round the banner of the princess.[SEP]And, to say truth, this was what[SEP]I thought most likely to happen.[SEP]For I had great doubts whether either[SEP]the King or Black Michael or I had more than a day to live.[SEP]Well, if[SEP]Black Michael died, and if I, the play-actor, slew Rupert Hentzau with[SEP]my own hand, and then died myself, it might be that Fate would deal[SEP]as lightly with Ruritania as could be hoped, notwithstanding that she[SEP]demanded the life of the King--and to her dealing thus with me, I was in[SEP]no temper to make objection.[EOT]
[SOT]It was late when we rose from conference, and I betook me to the[SEP]princess’s apartments.[SEP]She was pensive that evening; yet, when I left[SEP]her, she flung her arms about me and grew, for an instant, bashfully[SEP]radiant as she slipped a ring on my finger.[SEP]I was wearing the King’s[SEP]ring; but I had also on my little finger a plain band of gold engraved[SEP]with the motto of our family: “_Nil Quae Feci_.[SEP]” This I took off and put[SEP]on her, and signed to her to let me go.[SEP]And she, understanding, stood[SEP]away and watched me with dimmed eyes.[EOT]
[SOT]“Wear that ring, even though you wear another when you are queen,” I[SEP]said.[EOT]
[SOT]“Whatever else I wear, this I will wear till I die and after,” said she,[SEP]as she kissed the ring.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER 17[EOT]
[SOT]Young Rupert’s Midnight Diversions[EOT]
[SOT]The night came fine and clear.[SEP]I had prayed for dirty weather, such as[SEP]had favoured my previous voyage in the moat, but Fortune was this time[SEP]against me.[SEP]Still I reckoned that by keeping close under the wall and in[SEP]the shadow I could escape detection from the windows of the chateau[SEP]that looked out on the scene of my efforts.[SEP]If they searched the moat,[SEP]indeed, my scheme must fail; but I did not think they would.[SEP]They had[SEP]made “Jacob’s Ladder” secure against attack.[SEP]Johann had himself helped[SEP]to fix it closely to the masonry on the under side, so that it could[SEP]not now be moved from below any more than from above.[SEP]An assault with[SEP]explosives or a long battering with picks alone could displace it, and[SEP]the noise involved in either of these operations put them out of the[SEP]question.[SEP]What harm, then, could a man do in the moat?[SEP]I trusted that[SEP]Black Michael, putting this query to himself, would answer confidently,[SEP]“None;” while, even if Johann meant treachery, he did not know my[SEP]scheme, and would doubtless expect to see me, at the head of my friends,[SEP]before the front entrance to the chateau.[SEP]There, I said to Sapt, was the[SEP]real danger.[SEP]“And there,” I added, “you shall be.[SEP]Doesn’t that content[SEP]you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]But it did not.[SEP]Dearly would he have liked to come with me, had I not[SEP]utterly refused to take him.[SEP]One man might escape notice, to double[SEP]the party more than doubled the risk; and when he ventured to hint once[SEP]again that my life was too valuable, I, knowing the secret thought he[SEP]clung to, sternly bade him be silent, assuring him that unless the King[SEP]lived through the night, I would not live through it either.[EOT]
[SOT]At twelve o’clock, Sapt’s command left the chateau of Tarlenheim and[SEP]struck off to the right, riding by unfrequented roads, and avoiding the[SEP]town of Zenda.[SEP]If all went well, they would be in front of the Castle by[SEP]about a quarter to two.[SEP]Leaving their horses half a mile off, they were[SEP]to steal up to the entrance and hold themselves in readiness for the[SEP]opening of the door.[SEP]If the door were not opened by two, they were to[SEP]send Fritz von Tarlenheim round to the other side of the Castle.[SEP]I would[SEP]meet him there if I were alive, and we would consult whether to storm[SEP]the Castle or not.[SEP]If I were not there, they were to return with all[SEP]speed to Tarlenheim, rouse the Marshal, and march in force to Zenda.[SEP]For[SEP]if not there, I should be dead; and I knew that the King would not be[SEP]alive five minutes after I ceased to breathe.[SEP]I must now leave Sapt and[SEP]his friends, and relate how I myself proceeded on this eventful night.[SEP]I went out on the good horse which had carried me, on the night of[SEP]the coronation, back from the hunting-lodge to Strelsau.[SEP]I carried a[SEP]revolver in the saddle and my sword.[SEP]I was covered with a large cloak,[SEP]and under this I wore a warm, tight-fitting woollen jersey, a pair of[SEP]knickerbockers, thick stockings, and light canvas shoes.[SEP]I had rubbed[SEP]myself thoroughly with oil, and I carried a large flask of whisky.[SEP]The[SEP]night was warm, but I might probably be immersed a long while, and it[SEP]was necessary to take every precaution against cold: for cold not only[SEP]saps a man’s courage if he has to die, but impairs his energy if others[SEP]have to die, and, finally, gives him rheumatics, if it be God’s will[SEP]that he lives.[SEP]Also I tied round my body a length of thin but stout[SEP]cord, and I did not forget my ladder.[SEP]I, starting after Sapt, took a[SEP]shorter route, skirting the town to the left, and found myself in the[SEP]outskirts of the forest at about half-past twelve.[SEP]I tied my horse up[SEP]in a thick clump of trees, leaving the revolver in its pocket in the[SEP]saddle--it would be no use to me--and, ladder in hand, made my way to[SEP]the edge of the moat.[SEP]Here I unwound my rope from about my waist, bound[SEP]it securely round the trunk of a tree on the bank, and let myself down.[SEP]The Castle clock struck a quarter to one as I felt the water under me[SEP]and began to swim round the keep, pushing the ladder before me, and[SEP]hugging the Castle wall.[SEP]Thus voyaging, I came to my old friend,[SEP]“Jacob’s Ladder,” and felt the ledge of the masonry under me.[SEP]I crouched[SEP]down in the shadow of the great pipe--I tried to stir it, but it was[SEP]quite immovable--and waited.[SEP]I remember that my predominant feeling[SEP]was neither anxiety for the King nor longing for Flavia, but an intense[SEP]desire to smoke; and this craving, of course, I could not gratify.[EOT]
[SOT]The drawbridge was still in its place.[SEP]I saw its airy, slight framework[SEP]above me, some ten yards to my right, as I crouched with my back against[SEP]the wall of the King’s cell.[SEP]I made out a window two yards my side of it[SEP]and nearly on the same level.[SEP]That, if Johann spoke true, must belong to[SEP]the duke’s apartments; and on the other side, in about the same relative[SEP]position, must be Madame de Mauban’s window.[SEP]Women are careless,[SEP]forgetful creatures.[SEP]I prayed that she might not forget that she was to[SEP]be the victim of a brutal attempt at two o’clock precisely.[SEP]I was rather[SEP]amused at the part I had assigned to my young friend Rupert Hentzau; but[SEP]I owed him a stroke--for, even as I sat, my shoulder ached where he had,[SEP]with an audacity that seemed half to hide his treachery, struck at me,[SEP]in the sight of all my friends, on the terrace at Tarlenheim.[EOT]
[SOT]Suddenly the duke’s window grew bright.[SEP]The shutters were not closed,[SEP]and the interior became partially visible to me as I cautiously raised[SEP]myself till I stood on tiptoe.[SEP]Thus placed, my range of sight embraced a[SEP]yard or more inside the window, while the radius of light did not[SEP]reach me.[SEP]The window was flung open and someone looked out.[SEP]I marked[SEP]Antoinette de Mauban’s graceful figure, and, though her face was in[SEP]shadow, the fine outline of her head was revealed against the light[SEP]behind.[SEP]I longed to cry softly, “Remember![SEP]” but I dared not--and[SEP]happily, for a moment later a man came up and stood by her.[SEP]He tried to[SEP]put his arm round her waist, but with a swift motion she sprang away and[SEP]leant against the shutter, her profile towards me.[SEP]I made out who the[SEP]newcomer was: it was young Rupert.[SEP]A low laugh from him made me sure, as[SEP]he leant forward, stretching out his hand towards her.[EOT]
[SOT]“Gently, gently![SEP]” I murmured.[SEP]“You’re too soon, my boy![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]His head was close to hers.[SEP]I suppose he whispered to her, for I saw her[SEP]point to the moat, and I heard her say, in slow and distinct tones:[EOT]
[SOT]“I had rather throw myself out of this window![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He came close up to the window and looked out.[EOT]
[SOT]“It looks cold,” said he.[SEP]“Come, Antoinette, are you serious?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She made no answer so far as I heard; and he, smiting his hand petulantly[SEP]on the window-sill, went on, in the voice of some spoilt child:[EOT]
[SOT]“Hang Black Michael![SEP]Isn’t the princess enough for him?[SEP]Is he to have[SEP]everything?[SEP]What the devil do you see in Black Michael?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“If I told him what you say--” she began.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, tell him,” said Rupert, carelessly; and, catching her off her[SEP]guard, he sprang forward and kissed her, laughing, and crying, “There’s[SEP]something to tell him![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]If I had kept my revolver with me, I should have been very sorely[SEP]tempted.[SEP]Being spared the temptation, I merely added this new score to[SEP]his account.[EOT]
[SOT]“Though, faith,” said Rupert, “it’s little he cares.[SEP]He’s mad about the[SEP]princess, you know.[SEP]He talks of nothing but cutting the play-actor’s[SEP]throat.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Didn’t he, indeed?[EOT]
[SOT]“And if I do it for him, what do you think he’s promised me?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The unhappy woman raised her hands above her head, in prayer or in[SEP]despair.[EOT]
[SOT]“But I detest waiting,” said Rupert; and I saw that he was about to[SEP]lay his hand on her again, when there was a noise of a door in the room[SEP]opening, and a harsh voice cried:[EOT]
[SOT]“What are you doing here, sir?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Rupert turned his back to the window, bowed low, and said, in his loud,[SEP]merry tones: “Apologizing for your absence, sir.[SEP]Could I leave the lady[SEP]alone?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The newcomer must be Black Michael.[SEP]I saw him directly, as he advanced[SEP]towards the window.[SEP]He caught young Rupert by the arm.[EOT]
[SOT]“The moat would hold more than the King![SEP]” said he, with a significant[SEP]gesture.[EOT]
[SOT]“Does your Highness threaten me?[SEP]” asked Rupert.[EOT]
[SOT]“A threat is more warning than most men get from me.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yet,” observed Rupert, “Rudolf Rassendyll has been much threatened, and[SEP]yet lives![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Am I in fault because my servants bungle?[SEP]” asked Michael scornfully.[EOT]
[SOT]“Your Highness has run no risk of bungling![SEP]” sneered Rupert.[EOT]
[SOT]It was telling the duke that he shirked danger as plain as ever I[SEP]have heard a man told.[SEP]Black Michael had self-control.[SEP]I dare say he[SEP]scowled--it was a great regret to me that I could not see their faces[SEP]better--but his voice was even and calm, as he answered:[EOT]
[SOT]“Enough, enough![SEP]We mustn’t quarrel, Rupert.[SEP]Are Detchard and Bersonin[SEP]at their posts?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“They are, sir.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I need you no more.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Nay, I’m not oppressed with fatigue,” said Rupert.[EOT]
[SOT]“Pray, sir, leave us,” said Michael, more impatiently.[SEP]“In ten minutes[SEP]the drawbridge will be drawn back, and I presume you have no wish to[SEP]swim to your bed.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Rupert’s figure disappeared.[SEP]I heard the door open and shut again.[SEP]Michael and Antoinette de Mauban were left together.[SEP]To my chagrin,[SEP]the duke laid his hand on the window and closed it.[SEP]He stood talking[SEP]to Antoinette for a moment or two.[SEP]She shook her head, and he turned[SEP]impatiently away.[SEP]She left the window.[SEP]The door sounded again, and Black[SEP]Michael closed the shutters.[EOT]
[SOT]“De Gautet, De Gautet, man![SEP]” sounded from the drawbridge.[SEP]“Unless you[SEP]want a bath before your bed, come along![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]It was Rupert’s voice, coming from the end of the drawbridge.[SEP]A moment[SEP]later he and De Gautet stepped out on the bridge.[SEP]Rupert’s arm was[SEP]through De Gautet’s, and in the middle of the bridge he detained his[SEP]companion and leant over.[SEP]I dropped behind the shelter of “Jacob’s[SEP]Ladder.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Then Master Rupert had a little sport.[SEP]He took from De Gautet a bottle[SEP]which he carried, and put it to his lips.[EOT]
[SOT]“Hardly a drop![SEP]” he cried discontentedly, and flung it in the moat.[EOT]
[SOT]It fell, as I judged from the sound and the circles on the water, within[SEP]a yard of the pipe.[SEP]And Rupert, taking out his revolver, began to shoot[SEP]at it.[SEP]The first two shots missed the bottle, but hit the pipe.[SEP]The[SEP]third shattered the bottle.[SEP]I hoped that the young ruffian would be[SEP]content; but he emptied the other barrels at the pipe, and one, skimming[SEP]over the pipe, whistled through my hair as I crouched on the other side.[EOT]
[SOT]“‘Ware bridge![SEP]” a voice cried, to my relief.[EOT]
[SOT]Rupert and De Gautet cried, “A moment![SEP]” and ran across.[SEP]The bridge was[SEP]drawn back, and all became still.[SEP]The clock struck a quarter-past one.[SEP]I[SEP]rose and stretched myself and yawned.[EOT]
[SOT]I think some ten minutes had passed when I heard a slight noise to my[SEP]right.[SEP]I peered over the pipe, and saw a dark figure standing in the[SEP]gateway that led to the bridge.[SEP]It was a man.[SEP]By the careless, graceful[SEP]poise, I guessed it to be Rupert again.[SEP]He held a sword in his hand, and[SEP]he stood motionless for a minute or two.[SEP]Wild thoughts ran through me.[SEP]On what mischief was the young fiend bent now?[SEP]Then he laughed low[SEP]to himself; then he turned his face to the wall, took a step in my[SEP]direction, and, to my surprise, began to climb down the wall.[SEP]In an[SEP]instant I saw that there must be steps in the wall; it was plain.[SEP]They[SEP]were cut into or affixed to the wall, at intervals of about eighteen[SEP]inches.[SEP]Rupert set his foot on the lower one.[SEP]Then he placed his sword[SEP]between his teeth, turned round, and noiselessly let himself into the[SEP]water.[SEP]Had it been a matter of my life only, I would have swum to[SEP]meet him.[SEP]Dearly would I have loved to fight it out with him then and[SEP]there--with steel, on a fine night, and none to come between us.[SEP]But[SEP]there was the King![SEP]I restrained myself, but I could not bridle my swift[SEP]breathing, and I watched him with the intensest eagerness.[EOT]
[SOT]He swam leisurely and quietly across.[SEP]There were more steps up on[SEP]the other side, and he climbed them.[SEP]When he set foot in the gateway,[SEP]standing on the drawn-back bridge, he felt in his pocket and took[SEP]something out.[SEP]I heard him unlock the door.[SEP]I could hear no noise of its[SEP]closing behind him.[SEP]He vanished from my sight.[EOT]
[SOT]Abandoning my ladder--I saw I did not need it now--I swam to the side of[SEP]the bridge and climbed half way up the steps.[SEP]There I hung with my sword[SEP]in my hand, listening eagerly.[SEP]The duke’s room was shuttered and dark.[SEP]There was a light in the window on the opposite side of the bridge.[SEP]Not a sound broke the silence, till half-past one chimed from the great[SEP]clock in the tower of the chateau.[EOT]
[SOT]There were other plots than mine afoot in the Castle that night.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER 18[EOT]
[SOT]The Forcing of the Trap[EOT]
[SOT]The position wherein I stood does not appear very favourable to thought;[SEP]yet for the next moment or two I thought profoundly.[SEP]I had, I told[SEP]myself, scored one point.[SEP]Be Rupert Hentzau’s errand what it might, and[SEP]the villainy he was engaged on what it would, I had scored one point.[SEP]He[SEP]was on the other side of the moat from the King, and it would be by no[SEP]fault of mine if ever he set foot on the same side again.[SEP]I had three[SEP]left to deal with: two on guard and De Gautet in his bed.[SEP]Ah, if I[SEP]had the keys![SEP]I would have risked everything and attacked Detchard and[SEP]Bersonin before their friends could join them.[SEP]But I was powerless.[SEP]I[SEP]must wait till the coming of my friends enticed someone to cross the[SEP]bridge--someone with the keys.[SEP]And I waited, as it seemed, for half an[SEP]hour, really for about five minutes, before the next act in the rapid[SEP]drama began.[EOT]
[SOT]All was still on the other side.[SEP]The duke’s room remained inscrutable[SEP]behind its shutters.[SEP]The light burnt steadily in Madame de Mauban’s[SEP]window.[SEP]Then I heard the faintest, faintest sound: it came from behind[SEP]the door which led to the drawbridge on the other side of the moat.[SEP]It[SEP]but just reached my ear, yet I could not be mistaken as to what it was.[SEP]It was made by a key being turned very carefully and slowly.[SEP]Who was[SEP]turning it?[SEP]And of what room was it the key?[SEP]There leapt before my eyes[SEP]the picture of young Rupert, with the key in one hand, his sword in the[SEP]other, and an evil smile on his face.[SEP]But I did not know what door it[SEP]was, nor on which of his favourite pursuits young Rupert was spending[SEP]the hours of that night.[EOT]
[SOT]I was soon to be enlightened, for the next moment--before my friends[SEP]could be near the chateau door--before Johann the keeper would have[SEP]thought to nerve himself for his task--there was a sudden crash from[SEP]the room with the lighted window.[SEP]It sounded as though someone had flung[SEP]down a lamp; and the window went dark and black.[SEP]At the same instant a[SEP]cry rang out, shrill in the night: “Help, help![SEP]Michael, help![SEP]” and was[SEP]followed by a shriek of utter terror.[EOT]
[SOT]I was tingling in every nerve.[SEP]I stood on the topmost step, clinging to[SEP]the threshold of the gate with my right hand and holding my sword in my[SEP]left.[SEP]Suddenly I perceived that the gateway was broader than the bridge;[SEP]there was a dark corner on the opposite side where a man could stand.[SEP]I[SEP]darted across and stood there.[SEP]Thus placed, I commanded the path, and no[SEP]man could pass between the chateau and the old Castle till he had tried[SEP]conclusions with me.[EOT]
[SOT]There was another shriek.[SEP]Then a door was flung open and clanged against[SEP]the wall, and I heard the handle of a door savagely twisted.[EOT]
[SOT]“Open the door![SEP]In God’s name, what’s the matter?[SEP]” cried a voice--the[SEP]voice of Black Michael himself.[EOT]
[SOT]He was answered by the very words I had written in my letter.[EOT]
[SOT]“Help, Michael--Hentzau![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]A fierce oath rang out from the duke, and with a loud thud he threw[SEP]himself against the door.[SEP]At the same moment I heard a window above my[SEP]head open, and a voice cried: “What’s the matter?[SEP]” and I heard a man’s[SEP]hasty footsteps.[SEP]I grasped my sword.[SEP]If De Gautet came my way, the Six[SEP]would be less by one more.[EOT]
[SOT]Then I heard the clash of crossed swords and a tramp of feet and--I[SEP]cannot tell the thing so quickly as it happened, for all seemed to come[SEP]at once.[SEP]There was an angry cry from madame’s room, the cry of a wounded[SEP]man; the window was flung open; young Rupert stood there sword in hand.[SEP]He turned his back, and I saw his body go forward to the lunge.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah, Johann, there’s one for you![SEP]Come on, Michael![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Johann was there, then--come to the rescue of the duke![SEP]How would he[SEP]open the door for me?[SEP]For I feared that Rupert had slain him.[EOT]
[SOT]“Help![SEP]” cried the duke’s voice, faint and husky.[EOT]
[SOT]I heard a step on the stairs above me; and I heard a stir down to my[SEP]left, in the direction of the King’s cell.[SEP]But, before anything happened[SEP]on my side of the moat, I saw five or six men round young Rupert in[SEP]the embrasure of madame’s window.[SEP]Three or four times he lunged with[SEP]incomparable dash and dexterity.[SEP]For an instant they fell back, leaving[SEP]a ring round him.[SEP]He leapt on the parapet of the window, laughing as he[SEP]leapt, and waving his sword in his hand.[SEP]He was drunk with blood, and he[SEP]laughed again wildly as he flung himself headlong into the moat.[EOT]
[SOT]What became of him then?[SEP]I did not see: for as he leapt, De Gautet’s[SEP]lean face looked out through the door by me, and, without a second’s[SEP]hesitation, I struck at him with all the strength God had given me, and[SEP]he fell dead in the doorway without a word or a groan.[SEP]I dropped on my[SEP]knees by him.[SEP]Where were the keys?[SEP]I found myself muttering: “The keys,[SEP]man, the keys?[SEP]” as though he had been yet alive and could listen; and[SEP]when I could not find them, I--God forgive me![SEP]--I believe I struck a[SEP]dead man’s face.[EOT]
[SOT]At last I had them.[SEP]There were but three.[SEP]Seizing the largest, I felt[SEP]the lock of the door that led to the cell.[SEP]I fitted in the key.[SEP]It was[SEP]right.[SEP]The lock turned.[SEP]I drew the door close behind me and locked it as[SEP]noiselessly as I could, putting the key in my pocket.[EOT]
[SOT]I found myself at the top of a flight of steep stone stairs.[SEP]An oil lamp[SEP]burnt dimly in the bracket.[SEP]I took it down and held it in my hand; and I[SEP]stood and listened.[EOT]
[SOT]“What in the devil can it be?[SEP]” I heard a voice say.[EOT]
[SOT]It came from behind a door that faced me at the bottom of the stairs.[EOT]
[SOT]And another answered:[EOT]
[SOT]“Shall we kill him?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I strained to hear the answer, and could have sobbed with relief when[SEP]Detchard’s voice came grating and cold:[EOT]
[SOT]“Wait a bit.[SEP]There’ll be trouble if we strike too soon.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]There was a moment’s silence.[SEP]Then I heard the bolt of the door[SEP]cautiously drawn back.[SEP]Instantly I put out the light I held, replacing[SEP]the lamp in the bracket.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s dark--the lamp’s out.[SEP]Have you a light?[SEP]” said the other[SEP]voice--Bersonin’s.[EOT]
[SOT]No doubt they had a light, but they should not use it.[SEP]It was come to[SEP]the crisis now, and I rushed down the steps and flung myself against the[SEP]door.[SEP]Bersonin had unbolted it and it gave way before me.[SEP]The Belgian[SEP]stood there sword in hand, and Detchard was sitting on a couch at the[SEP]side of the room.[SEP]In astonishment at seeing me, Bersonin recoiled;[SEP]Detchard jumped to his sword.[SEP]I rushed madly at the Belgian: he gave[SEP]way before me, and I drove him up against the wall.[SEP]He was no swordsman,[SEP]though he fought bravely, and in a moment he lay on the floor before[SEP]me.[SEP]I turned--Detchard was not there.[SEP]Faithful to his orders, he had[SEP]not risked a fight with me, but had rushed straight to the door of the[SEP]King’s room, opened it and slammed it behind him.[SEP]Even now he was at his[SEP]work inside.[EOT]
[SOT]And surely he would have killed the King, and perhaps me also, had it[SEP]not been for one devoted man who gave his life for the King.[SEP]For when I[SEP]forced the door, the sight I saw was this: the King stood in the corner[SEP]of the room: broken by his sickness, he could do nothing; his fettered[SEP]hands moved uselessly up and down, and he was laughing horribly in[SEP]half-mad delirium.[SEP]Detchard and the doctor were together in the middle[SEP]of the room; and the doctor had flung himself on the murderer, pinning[SEP]his hands to his sides for an instant.[SEP]Then Detchard wrenched himself[SEP]free from the feeble grip, and, as I entered, drove his sword through[SEP]the hapless man.[SEP]Then he turned on me, crying:[EOT]
[SOT]“At last![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]We were sword to sword.[SEP]By blessed chance, neither he nor Bersonin had[SEP]been wearing their revolvers.[SEP]I found them afterwards, ready loaded,[SEP]on the mantelpiece of the outer room: it was hard by the door, ready to[SEP]their hands, but my sudden rush in had cut off access to them.[SEP]Yes, we[SEP]were man to man: and we began to fight, silently, sternly, and hard.[SEP]Yet I remember little of it, save that the man was my match with the[SEP]sword--nay, and more, for he knew more tricks than I; and that he forced[SEP]me back against the bars that guarded the entrance to “Jacob’s Ladder.[SEP]”[SEP]And I saw a smile on his face, and he wounded me in the left arm.[EOT]
[SOT]No glory do I take for that contest.[SEP]I believe that the man would have[SEP]mastered me and slain me, and then done his butcher’s work, for he was[SEP]the most skilful swordsman I have ever met; but even as he pressed me[SEP]hard, the half-mad, wasted, wan creature in the corner leapt high in[SEP]lunatic mirth, shrieking:[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s cousin Rudolf![SEP]Cousin Rudolf![SEP]I’ll help you, cousin Rudolf![SEP]” and[SEP]catching up a chair in his hands (he could but just lift it from the[SEP]ground and hold it uselessly before him) he came towards us.[SEP]Hope came[SEP]to me.[SEP]“Come on![SEP]” I cried.[SEP]“Come on![SEP]Drive it against his legs.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Detchard replied with a savage thrust.[SEP]He all but had me.[EOT]
[SOT]“Come on![SEP]Come on, man![SEP]” I cried.[SEP]“Come and share the fun![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]And the King laughed gleefully, and came on, pushing his chair before[SEP]him.[EOT]
[SOT]With an oath Detchard skipped back, and, before I knew what he was[SEP]doing, had turned his sword against the King.[SEP]He made one fierce cut at[SEP]the King, and the King, with a piteous cry, dropped where he stood.[SEP]The[SEP]stout ruffian turned to face me again.[SEP]But his own hand had prepared[SEP]his destruction: for in turning he trod in the pool of blood that flowed[SEP]from the dead physician.[SEP]He slipped; he fell.[SEP]Like a dart I was upon[SEP]him.[SEP]I caught him by the throat, and before he could recover himself I[SEP]drove my point through his neck, and with a stifled curse he fell across[SEP]the body of his victim.[EOT]
[SOT]Was the King dead?[SEP]It was my first thought.[SEP]I rushed to where he lay.[SEP]Ay, it seemed as if he were dead, for he had a great gash across his[SEP]forehead, and he lay still in a huddled heap on the floor.[SEP]I dropped on[SEP]my knees beside him, and leant my ear down to hear if he breathed.[SEP]But[SEP]before I could there was a loud rattle from the outside.[SEP]I knew the[SEP]sound: the drawbridge was being pushed out.[SEP]A moment later it rang home[SEP]against the wall on my side of the moat.[SEP]I should be caught in a trap[SEP]and the King with me, if he yet lived.[SEP]He must take his chance, to[SEP]live or die.[SEP]I took my sword, and passed into the outer room.[SEP]Who were[SEP]pushing the drawbridge out--my men?[SEP]If so, all was well.[SEP]My eye fell on[SEP]the revolvers, and I seized one; and paused to listen in the doorway of[SEP]the outer room.[SEP]To listen, say I?[SEP]Yes, and to get my breath: and I tore[SEP]my shirt and twisted a strip of it round my bleeding arm; and stood[SEP]listening again.[SEP]I would have given the world to hear Sapt’s voice.[SEP]For[SEP]I was faint, spent, and weary.[SEP]And that wild-cat Rupert Hentzau was yet[SEP]at large in the Castle.[SEP]Yet, because I could better defend the narrow[SEP]door at the top of the stairs than the wider entrance to the room, I[SEP]dragged myself up the steps, and stood behind it listening.[EOT]
[SOT]What was the sound?[SEP]Again a strange one for the place and time.[SEP]An[SEP]easy, scornful, merry laugh--the laugh of young Rupert Hentzau![SEP]I could[SEP]scarcely believe that a sane man would laugh.[SEP]Yet the laugh told me that[SEP]my men had not come; for they must have shot Rupert ere now, if they had[SEP]come.[SEP]And the clock struck half-past two![SEP]My God![SEP]The door had not been[SEP]opened![SEP]They had gone to the bank![SEP]They had not found me![SEP]They had gone[SEP]by now back to Tarlenheim, with the news of the King’s death--and mine.[SEP]Well, it would be true before they got there.[SEP]Was not Rupert laughing in[SEP]triumph?[EOT]
[SOT]For a moment, I sank, unnerved, against the door.[SEP]Then I started up[SEP]alert again, for Rupert cried scornfully:[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, the bridge is there![SEP]Come over it![SEP]And in God’s name, let’s see[SEP]Black Michael.[SEP]Keep back, you curs![SEP]Michael, come and fight for her![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]If it were a three-cornered fight, I might yet bear my part.[SEP]I turned[SEP]the key in the door and looked out.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER 19[EOT]
[SOT]Face to Face in the Forest[EOT]
[SOT]For a moment I could see nothing, for the glare of lanterns and torches[SEP]caught me full in the eyes from the other side of the bridge.[SEP]But soon[SEP]the scene grew clear: and it was a strange scene.[SEP]The bridge was in its[SEP]place.[SEP]At the far end of it stood a group of the duke’s servants; two or[SEP]three carried the lights which had dazzled me, three or four held pikes[SEP]in rest.[SEP]They were huddled together; their weapons were protruded before[SEP]them; their faces were pale and agitated.[SEP]To put it plainly, they[SEP]looked in as arrant a fright as I have seen men look, and they gazed[SEP]apprehensively at a man who stood in the middle of the bridge, sword in[SEP]hand.[SEP]Rupert Hentzau was in his trousers and shirt; the white linen[SEP]was stained with blood, but his easy, buoyant pose told me that he was[SEP]himself either not touched at all or merely scratched.[SEP]There he stood,[SEP]holding the bridge against them, and daring them to come on; or, rather,[SEP]bidding them send Black Michael to him; and they, having no firearms,[SEP]cowered before the desperate man and dared not attack him.[SEP]They[SEP]whispered to one another; and in the backmost rank, I saw my friend[SEP]Johann, leaning against the portal of the door and stanching with a[SEP]handkerchief the blood which flowed from a wound in his cheek.[EOT]
[SOT]By marvellous chance, I was master.[SEP]The cravens would oppose me no more[SEP]than they dared attack Rupert.[SEP]I had but to raise my revolver, and I[SEP]sent him to his account with his sins on his head.[SEP]He did not so much as[SEP]know that I was there.[SEP]I did nothing--why, I hardly know to this day.[SEP]I had killed one man stealthily that night, and another by luck rather[SEP]than skill--perhaps it was that.[SEP]Again, villain as the man was, I did[SEP]not relish being one of a crowd against him--perhaps it was that.[SEP]But[SEP]stronger than either of these restrained feelings came a curiosity and[SEP]a fascination which held me spellbound, watching for the outcome of the[SEP]scene.[EOT]
[SOT]“Michael, you dog![SEP]Michael![SEP]If you can stand, come on![SEP]” cried Rupert;[SEP]and he advanced a step, the group shrinking back a little before him.[SEP]“Michael, you bastard![SEP]Come on![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The answer to his taunts came in the wild cry of a woman:[EOT]
[SOT]“He’s dead![SEP]My God, he’s dead![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Dead![SEP]” shouted Rupert.[SEP]“I struck better than I knew![SEP]” and he laughed[SEP]triumphantly.[SEP]Then he went on: “Down with your weapons there![SEP]I’m your[SEP]master now![SEP]Down with them, I say![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I believe they would have obeyed, but as he spoke came new things.[SEP]First, there arose a distant sound, as of shouts and knockings from the[SEP]other side of the chateau.[SEP]My heart leapt.[SEP]It must be my men, come by a[SEP]happy disobedience to seek me.[SEP]The noise continued, but none of the[SEP]rest seemed to heed it.[SEP]Their attention was chained by what now happened[SEP]before their eyes.[SEP]The group of servants parted and a woman staggered on[SEP]to the bridge.[SEP]Antoinette de Mauban was in a loose white robe, her dark[SEP]hair streamed over her shoulders, her face was ghastly pale, and her[SEP]eyes gleamed wildly in the light of the torches.[SEP]In her shaking hand she[SEP]held a revolver, and, as she tottered forward, she fired it at Rupert[SEP]Hentzau.[SEP]The ball missed him, and struck the woodwork over my head.[EOT]
[SOT]“Faith, madame,” laughed Rupert, “had your eyes been no more deadly[SEP]than your shooting, I had not been in this scrape--nor Black Michael in[SEP]hell--tonight![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She took no notice of his words.[SEP]With a wonderful effort, she[SEP]calmed herself till she stood still and rigid.[SEP]Then very slowly and[SEP]deliberately she began to raise her arm again, taking most careful aim.[EOT]
[SOT]He would be mad to risk it.[SEP]He must rush on her, chancing the bullet, or[SEP]retreat towards me.[SEP]I covered him with my weapon.[EOT]
[SOT]He did neither.[SEP]Before she had got her aim, he bowed in his most[SEP]graceful fashion, cried “I can’t kill where I’ve kissed,” and before[SEP]she or I could stop him, laid his hand on the parapet of the bridge, and[SEP]lightly leapt into the moat.[EOT]
[SOT]At that very moment I heard a rush of feet, and a voice I[SEP]knew--Sapt’s--cry: “God![SEP]it’s the duke--dead![SEP]” Then I knew that the King[SEP]needed me no more, and throwing down my revolver, I sprang out on the[SEP]bridge.[SEP]There was a cry of wild wonder, “The King![SEP]” and then I, like[SEP]Rupert of Hentzau, sword in hand, vaulted over the parapet, intent on[SEP]finishing my quarrel with him where I saw his curly head fifteen yards[SEP]off in the water of the moat.[EOT]
[SOT]He swam swiftly and easily.[SEP]I was weary and half crippled with my[SEP]wounded arm.[SEP]I could not gain on him.[SEP]For a time I made no sound, but as[SEP]we rounded the corner of the old keep I cried:[EOT]
[SOT]“Stop, Rupert, stop![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I saw him look over his shoulder, but he swam on.[SEP]He was under the bank[SEP]now, searching, as I guessed, for a spot that he could climb.[SEP]I knew[SEP]there to be none--but there was my rope, which would still be hanging[SEP]where I had left it.[SEP]He would come to where it was before I could.[SEP]Perhaps he would miss it--perhaps he would find it; and if he drew it up[SEP]after him, he would get a good start of me.[SEP]I put forth all my remaining[SEP]strength and pressed on.[SEP]At last I began to gain on him; for he,[SEP]occupied with his search, unconsciously slackened his pace.[EOT]
[SOT]Ah, he had found it![SEP]A low shout of triumph came from him.[SEP]He laid[SEP]hold of it and began to haul himself up.[SEP]I was near enough to hear him[SEP]mutter: “How the devil comes this here?[SEP]” I was at the rope, and he,[SEP]hanging in mid air, saw me, but I could not reach him.[EOT]
[SOT]“Hullo![SEP]who’s here?[SEP]” he cried in startled tones.[EOT]
[SOT]For a moment, I believe, he took me for the King--I dare say I was pale[SEP]enough to lend colour to the thought; but an instant later he cried:[EOT]
[SOT]“Why it’s the play-actor![SEP]How come you here, man?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]And so saying he gained the bank.[EOT]
[SOT]I laid hold of the rope, but I paused.[SEP]He stood on the bank, sword in[SEP]hand, and he could cut my head open or spit me through the heart as I[SEP]came up.[SEP]I let go the rope.[EOT]
[SOT]“Never mind,” said I; “but as I am here, I think I’ll stay.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He smiled down on me.[EOT]
[SOT]“These women are the deuce--” he began; when suddenly the great bell of[SEP]the Castle started to ring furiously, and a loud shout reached us from[SEP]the moat.[EOT]
[SOT]Rupert smiled again, and waved his hand to me.[EOT]
[SOT]“I should like a turn with you, but it’s a little too hot![SEP]” said he, and[SEP]he disappeared from above me.[EOT]
[SOT]In an instant, without thinking of danger, I laid my hand to the rope.[SEP]I was up.[SEP]I saw him thirty yards off, running like a deer towards the[SEP]shelter of the forest.[SEP]For once Rupert Hentzau had chosen discretion for[SEP]his part.[SEP]I laid my feet to the ground and rushed after him, calling to[SEP]him to stand.[SEP]He would not.[SEP]Unwounded and vigorous, he gained on me at[SEP]every step; but, forgetting everything in the world except him and my[SEP]thirst for his blood, I pressed on, and soon the deep shades of the[SEP]forest of Zenda engulfed us both, pursued and pursuer.[EOT]
[SOT]It was three o’clock now, and day was dawning.[SEP]I was on a long straight[SEP]grass avenue, and a hundred yards ahead ran young Rupert, his curls[SEP]waving in the fresh breeze.[SEP]I was weary and panting; he looked over his[SEP]shoulder and waved his hand again to me.[SEP]He was mocking me, for he saw[SEP]he had the pace of me.[SEP]I was forced to pause for breath.[SEP]A moment later,[SEP]Rupert turned sharply to the right and was lost from my sight.[EOT]
[SOT]I thought all was over, and in deep vexation sank on the ground.[SEP]But I[SEP]was up again directly, for a scream rang through the forest--a woman’s[SEP]scream.[SEP]Putting forth the last of my strength, I ran on to the place[SEP]where he had turned out of my sight, and, turning also, I saw him again.[SEP]But alas![SEP]I could not touch him.[SEP]He was in the act of lifting a girl[SEP]down from her horse; doubtless it was her scream that I heard.[SEP]She[SEP]looked like a small farmer’s or a peasant’s daughter, and she carried[SEP]a basket on her arm.[SEP]Probably she was on her way to the early market at[SEP]Zenda.[SEP]Her horse was a stout, well shaped animal.[SEP]Master Rupert lifted[SEP]her down amid her shrieks--the sight of him frightened her; but he[SEP]treated her gently, laughed, kissed her, and gave her money.[SEP]Then he[SEP]jumped on the horse, sitting sideways like a woman; and then he waited[SEP]for me.[SEP]I, on my part, waited for him.[EOT]
[SOT]Presently he rode towards me, keeping his distance, however.[SEP]He lifted[SEP]up his hand, saying:[EOT]
[SOT]“What did you in the Castle?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I killed three of your friends,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“What![SEP]You got to the cells?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And the King?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He was hurt by Detchard before I killed Detchard, but I pray that he[SEP]lives.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“You fool![SEP]” said Rupert, pleasantly.[EOT]
[SOT]“One thing more I did.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And what’s that?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I spared your life.[SEP]I was behind you on the bridge, with a revolver in[SEP]my hand.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No?[SEP]Faith, I was between two fires![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Get off your horse,” I cried, “and fight like a man.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Before a lady![SEP]” said he, pointing to the girl.[SEP]“Fie, your Majesty![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Then in my rage, hardly knowing what I did, I rushed at him.[SEP]For a[SEP]moment he seemed to waver.[SEP]Then he reined his horse in and stood waiting[SEP]for me.[SEP]On I went in my folly.[SEP]I seized the bridle and I struck at him.[SEP]He parried and thrust at me.[SEP]I fell back a pace and rushed at him again;[SEP]and this time I reached his face and laid his cheek open, and darted[SEP]back almost before he could strike me.[SEP]He seemed almost dazed at the[SEP]fierceness of my attack; otherwise I think he must have killed me.[SEP]I[SEP]sank on my knee panting, expecting him to ride at me.[SEP]And so he would[SEP]have done, and then and there, I doubt not, one or both of us would have[SEP]died; but at the moment there came a shout from behind us, and, looking[SEP]round, I saw, just at the turn of the avenue, a man on a horse.[SEP]He was[SEP]riding hard, and he carried a revolver in his hand.[SEP]It was Fritz von[SEP]Tarlenheim, my faithful friend.[SEP]Rupert saw him, and knew that the game[SEP]was up.[SEP]He checked his rush at me and flung his leg over the saddle, but[SEP]yet for just a moment he waited.[SEP]Leaning forward, he tossed his hair off[SEP]his forehead and smiled, and said: “_Au revoir_, Rudolf Rassendyll![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Then, with his cheek streaming blood, but his lips laughing and his[SEP]body swaying with ease and grace, he bowed to me; and he bowed to the[SEP]farm-girl, who had drawn near in trembling fascination, and he waved his[SEP]hand to Fritz, who was just within range and let fly a shot at him.[SEP]The[SEP]ball came nigh doing its work, for it struck the sword he held, and he[SEP]dropped the sword with an oath, wringing his fingers and clapped his[SEP]heels hard on his horse’s belly, and rode away at a gallop.[EOT]
[SOT]And I watched him go down the long avenue, riding as though he rode for[SEP]his pleasure and singing as he went, for all there was that gash in his[SEP]cheek.[EOT]
[SOT]Once again he turned to wave his hand, and then the gloom of thickets[SEP]swallowed him and he was lost from our sight.[SEP]Thus he vanished--reckless[SEP]and wary, graceful and graceless, handsome, debonair, vile, and[SEP]unconquered.[SEP]And I flung my sword passionately on the ground and cried[SEP]to Fritz to ride after him.[SEP]But Fritz stopped his horse, and leapt down[SEP]and ran to me, and knelt, putting his arm about me.[SEP]And indeed it was[SEP]time, for the wound that Detchard had given me was broken forth afresh,[SEP]and my blood was staining the ground.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then give me the horse![SEP]” I cried, staggering to my feet and throwing[SEP]his arms off me.[SEP]And the strength of my rage carried me so far as where[SEP]the horse stood, and then I fell prone beside it.[SEP]And Fritz knelt by me[SEP]again.[EOT]
[SOT]“Fritz![SEP]” I said.[EOT]
[SOT]“Ay, friend--dear friend![SEP]” he said, tender as a woman.[EOT]
[SOT]“Is the King alive?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He took his handkerchief and wiped my lips, and bent and kissed me on[SEP]the forehead.[EOT]
[SOT]“Thanks to the most gallant gentleman that lives,” said he softly, “the[SEP]King is alive![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]The little farm-girl stood by us, weeping for fright and wide-eyed for[SEP]wonder; for she had seen me at Zenda; and was not I, pallid, dripping,[SEP]foul, and bloody as I was--yet was not I the King?[EOT]
[SOT]And when I heard that the King was alive, I strove to cry “Hurrah![SEP]” But[SEP]I could not speak, and I laid my head back in Fritz’s arms and closed[SEP]my eyes, and I groaned; and then, lest Fritz should do me wrong in his[SEP]thoughts, I opened my eyes and tried to say “Hurrah![SEP]” again.[SEP]But I could[SEP]not.[SEP]And being very tired, and now very cold, I huddled myself close up[SEP]to Fritz, to get the warmth of him, and shut my eyes again and went to[SEP]sleep.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER 20[EOT]
[SOT]The Prisoner and the King[EOT]
[SOT]In order to a full understanding of what had occurred in the Castle of[SEP]Zenda, it is necessary to supplement my account of what I myself saw[SEP]and did on that night by relating briefly what I afterwards learnt[SEP]from Fritz and Madame de Mauban.[SEP]The story told by the latter explained[SEP]clearly how it happened that the cry which I had arranged as a stratagem[SEP]and a sham had come, in dreadful reality, before its time, and had thus,[SEP]as it seemed at the moment, ruined our hopes, while in the end it[SEP]had favoured them.[SEP]The unhappy woman, fired, I believe by a genuine[SEP]attachment to the Duke of Strelsau, no less than by the dazzling[SEP]prospects which a dominion over him opened before her eyes, had followed[SEP]him at his request from Paris to Ruritania.[SEP]He was a man of strong[SEP]passions, but of stronger will, and his cool head ruled both.[SEP]He was[SEP]content to take all and give nothing.[SEP]When she arrived, she was not[SEP]long in finding that she had a rival in the Princess Flavia; rendered[SEP]desperate, she stood at nothing which might give, or keep for her, her[SEP]power over the duke.[SEP]As I say, he took and gave not.[SEP]Simultaneously,[SEP]Antoinette found herself entangled in his audacious schemes.[SEP]Unwilling[SEP]to abandon him, bound to him by the chains of shame and hope, yet she[SEP]would not be a decoy, nor, at his bidding, lure me to death.[SEP]Hence the[SEP]letters of warning she had written.[SEP]Whether the lines she sent to Flavia[SEP]were inspired by good or bad feeling, by jealousy or by pity, I do not[SEP]know; but here also she served us well.[SEP]When the duke went to Zenda, she[SEP]accompanied him; and here for the first time she learnt the full measure[SEP]of his cruelty, and was touched with compassion for the unfortunate[SEP]King.[SEP]From this time she was with us; yet, from what she told me, I know[SEP]that she still (as women will) loved Michael, and trusted to gain[SEP]his life, if not his pardon, from the King, as the reward for her[SEP]assistance.[SEP]His triumph she did not desire, for she loathed his crime,[SEP]and loathed yet more fiercely what would be the prize of it--his[SEP]marriage with his cousin, Princess Flavia.[EOT]
[SOT]At Zenda new forces came into play--the lust and daring of young Rupert.[SEP]He was caught by her beauty, perhaps; perhaps it was enough for him that[SEP]she belonged to another man, and that she hated him.[SEP]For many days there[SEP]had been quarrels and ill will between him and the duke, and the scene[SEP]which I had witnessed in the duke’s room was but one of many.[SEP]Rupert’s[SEP]proposals to me, of which she had, of course, been ignorant, in no[SEP]way surprised her when I related them; she had herself warned Michael[SEP]against Rupert, even when she was calling on me to deliver her from both[SEP]of them.[SEP]On this night, then, Rupert had determined to have his will.[SEP]When she had gone to her room, he, having furnished himself with a key[SEP]to it, had made his entrance.[SEP]Her cries had brought the duke, and there[SEP]in the dark room, while she screamed, the men had fought; and Rupert,[SEP]having wounded his master with a mortal blow, had, on the servants[SEP]rushing in, escaped through the window as I have described.[SEP]The duke’s[SEP]blood, spurting out, had stained his opponent’s shirt; but Rupert, not[SEP]knowing that he had dealt Michael his death, was eager to finish the[SEP]encounter.[SEP]How he meant to deal with the other three of the band, I know[SEP]not.[SEP]I dare say he did not think, for the killing of Michael was not[SEP]premeditated.[SEP]Antoinette, left alone with the duke, had tried to stanch[SEP]his wound, and thus was she busied till he died; and then, hearing[SEP]Rupert’s taunts, she had come forth to avenge him.[SEP]Me she had not seen,[SEP]nor did she till I darted out of my ambush, and leapt after Rupert into[SEP]the moat.[EOT]
[SOT]The same moment found my friends on the scene.[SEP]They had reached the[SEP]chateau in due time, and waited ready by the door.[SEP]But Johann, swept[SEP]with the rest to the rescue of the duke, did not open it; nay, he took[SEP]a part against Rupert, putting himself forward more bravely than any[SEP]in his anxiety to avert suspicion; and he had received a wound, in the[SEP]embrasure of the window.[SEP]Till nearly half-past two Sapt waited; then,[SEP]following my orders, he had sent Fritz to search the banks of the moat.[SEP]I was not there.[SEP]Hastening back, Fritz told Sapt; and Sapt was for[SEP]following orders still, and riding at full speed back to Tarlenheim;[SEP]while Fritz would not hear of abandoning me, let me have ordered what I[SEP]would.[SEP]On this they disputed some few minutes; then Sapt, persuaded by[SEP]Fritz, detached a party under Bernenstein to gallop back to Tarlenheim[SEP]and bring up the marshal, while the rest fell to on the great door[SEP]of the chateau.[SEP]For several minutes it resisted them; then, just as[SEP]Antoinette de Mauban fired at Rupert of Hentzau on the bridge, they[SEP]broke in, eight of them in all: and the first door they came to was the[SEP]door of Michael’s room; and Michael lay dead across the threshold, with[SEP]a sword-thrust through his breast.[SEP]Sapt cried out at his death, as I[SEP]had heard, and they rushed on the servants; but these, in fear, dropped[SEP]their weapons, and Antoinette flung herself weeping at Sapt’s feet.[SEP]And[SEP]all she cried was that I had been at the end of the bridge and leapt[SEP]off.[SEP]“What of the prisoner?[SEP]” asked Sapt; but she shook her head.[SEP]Then[SEP]Sapt and Fritz, with the gentlemen behind them, crossed the bridge,[SEP]slowly, warily, and without noise; and Fritz stumbled over the body of[SEP]De Gautet in the way of the door.[SEP]They felt him and found him dead.[EOT]
[SOT]Then they consulted, listening eagerly for any sound from the cells[SEP]below; but there came none, and they were greatly afraid that the King’s[SEP]guards had killed him, and having pushed his body through the great[SEP]pipe, had escaped the same way themselves.[SEP]Yet, because I had been seen[SEP]here, they had still some hope (thus indeed Fritz, in his friendship,[SEP]told me); and going back to Michael’s body, pushing aside Antoinette,[SEP]who prayed by it, they found a key to the door which I had locked, and[SEP]opened the door.[SEP]The staircase was dark, and they would not use a torch[SEP]at first, lest they should be more exposed to fire.[SEP]But soon Fritz[SEP]cried: “The door down there is open![SEP]See, there is light![SEP]” So they went[SEP]on boldly, and found none to oppose them.[SEP]And when they came to the[SEP]outer room and saw the Belgian, Bersonin, lying dead, they thanked God,[SEP]Sapt saying: “Ay, he has been here.[SEP]” Then rushing into the King’s cell,[SEP]they found Detchard lying dead across the dead physician, and the King[SEP]on his back with his chair by him.[SEP]And Fritz cried: “He’s dead![SEP]” and[SEP]Sapt drove all out of the room except Fritz, and knelt down by the King;[SEP]and, having learnt more of wounds and the sign of death than I, he soon[SEP]knew that the King was not dead, nor, if properly attended, would die.[SEP]And they covered his face and carried him to Duke Michael’s room, and[SEP]laid him there; and Antoinette rose from praying by the body of the duke[SEP]and went to bathe the King’s head and dress his wounds, till a doctor[SEP]came.[SEP]And Sapt, seeing I had been there, and having heard Antoinette’s[SEP]story, sent Fritz to search the moat and then the forest.[SEP]He dared send[SEP]no one else.[SEP]And Fritz found my horse, and feared the worst.[SEP]Then, as I[SEP]have told, he found me, guided by the shout with which I had called on[SEP]Rupert to stop and face me.[SEP]And I think a man has never been more glad[SEP]to find his own brother alive than was Fritz to come on me; so that, in[SEP]love and anxiety for me, he thought nothing of a thing so great as would[SEP]have been the death of Rupert Hentzau.[SEP]Yet, had Fritz killed him, I[SEP]should have grudged it.[EOT]
[SOT]The enterprise of the King’s rescue being thus prosperously concluded,[SEP]it lay on Colonel Sapt to secure secrecy as to the King ever having[SEP]been in need of rescue.[SEP]Antoinette de Mauban and Johann the keeper (who,[SEP]indeed, was too much hurt to be wagging his tongue just now) were sworn[SEP]to reveal nothing; and Fritz went forth to find--not the King, but the[SEP]unnamed friend of the King, who had lain in Zenda and flashed for[SEP]a moment before the dazed eyes of Duke Michael’s servants on the[SEP]drawbridge.[SEP]The metamorphosis had happened; and the King, wounded almost[SEP]to death by the attacks of the gaolers who guarded his friend, had[SEP]at last overcome them, and rested now, wounded but alive, in Black[SEP]Michael’s own room in the Castle.[SEP]There he had been carried, his face[SEP]covered with a cloak, from the cell; and thence orders issued, that if[SEP]his friend were found, he should be brought directly and privately to[SEP]the King, and that meanwhile messengers should ride at full speed to[SEP]Tarlenheim, to tell Marshall Strakencz to assure the princess of the[SEP]King’s safety and to come himself with all speed to greet the King.[SEP]The princess was enjoined to remain at Tarlenheim, and there await her[SEP]cousin’s coming or his further injunctions.[SEP]Thus the King would come[SEP]to his own again, having wrought brave deeds, and escaped, almost by a[SEP]miracle, the treacherous assault of his unnatural brother.[EOT]
[SOT]This ingenious arrangement of my long-headed old friend prospered in[SEP]every way, save where it encountered a force that often defeats the most[SEP]cunning schemes.[SEP]I mean nothing else than the pleasure of a woman.[SEP]For,[SEP]let her cousin and sovereign send what command he chose (or Colonel[SEP]Sapt chose for him), and let Marshal Strakencz insist as he would, the[SEP]Princess Flavia was in no way minded to rest at Tarlenheim while her[SEP]lover lay wounded at Zenda; and when the Marshal, with a small suite,[SEP]rode forth from Tarlenheim on the way to Zenda, the princess’s carriage[SEP]followed immediately behind, and in this order they passed through the[SEP]town, where the report was already rife that the King, going the night[SEP]before to remonstrate with his brother, in all friendliness, for that[SEP]he held one of the King’s friends in confinement in the Castle, had been[SEP]most traitorously set upon; that there had been a desperate conflict;[SEP]that the duke was slain with several of his gentlemen; and that the[SEP]King, wounded as he was, had seized and held the Castle of Zenda.[SEP]All of[SEP]which talk made, as may be supposed, a mighty excitement: and the wires[SEP]were set in motion, and the tidings came to Strelsau only just after[SEP]orders had been sent thither to parade the troops and overawe the[SEP]dissatisfied quarters of the town with a display of force.[EOT]
[SOT]Thus the Princess Flavia came to Zenda.[SEP]And as she drove up the hill,[SEP]with the Marshal riding by the wheel and still imploring her to return[SEP]in obedience to the King’s orders, Fritz von Tarlenheim, with the[SEP]prisoner of Zenda, came to the edge of the forest.[SEP]I had revived from[SEP]my swoon, and walked, resting on Fritz’s arm; and looking out from the[SEP]cover of the trees, I saw the princess.[SEP]Suddenly understanding from a[SEP]glance at my companion’s face that we must not meet her, I sank on my[SEP]knees behind a clump of bushes.[SEP]But there was one whom we had forgotten,[SEP]but who followed us, and was not disposed to let slip the chance of[SEP]earning a smile and maybe a crown or two; and, while we lay hidden,[SEP]the little farm-girl came by us and ran to the princess, curtseying and[SEP]crying:[EOT]
[SOT]“Madame, the King is here--in the bushes![SEP]May I guide you to him,[SEP]madame?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Nonsense, child![SEP]” said old Strakencz; “the King lies wounded in the[SEP]Castle.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, sir, he’s wounded, I know; but he’s there--with Count Fritz--and[SEP]not at the Castle,” she persisted.[EOT]
[SOT]“Is he in two places, or are there two Kings?[SEP]” asked Flavia, bewildered.[SEP]“And how should he be there?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He pursued a gentleman, madame, and they fought till Count Fritz came;[SEP]and the other gentleman took my father’s horse from me and rode away;[SEP]but the King is here with Count Fritz.[SEP]Why, madame, is there another man[SEP]in Ruritania like the King?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No, my child,” said Flavia softly (I was told it afterwards), and she[SEP]smiled and gave the girl money.[SEP]“I will go and see this gentleman,” and[SEP]she rose to alight from the carriage.[EOT]
[SOT]But at this moment Sapt came riding from the Castle, and, seeing the[SEP]princess, made the best of a bad job, and cried to her that the King was[SEP]well tended and in no danger.[EOT]
[SOT]“In the Castle?[SEP]” she asked.[EOT]
[SOT]“Where else, madame?[SEP]” said he, bowing.[EOT]
[SOT]“But this girl says he is yonder--with Count Fritz.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt turned his eyes on the child with an incredulous smile.[EOT]
[SOT]“Every fine gentleman is a King to such,” said he.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why, he’s as like the King as one pea to another, madame![SEP]” cried the[SEP]girl, a little shaken but still obstinate.[EOT]
[SOT]Sapt started round.[SEP]The old Marshal’s face asked unspoken questions.[SEP]Flavia’s glance was no less eloquent.[SEP]Suspicion spread quick.[EOT]
[SOT]“I’ll ride myself and see this man,” said Sapt hastily.[EOT]
[SOT]“Nay, I’ll come myself,” said the princess.[EOT]
[SOT]“Then come alone,” he whispered.[EOT]
[SOT]And she, obedient to the strange hinting in his face, prayed the Marshal[SEP]and the rest to wait; and she and Sapt came on foot towards where we[SEP]lay, Sapt waving to the farm-girl to keep at a distance.[SEP]And when I saw[SEP]them coming, I sat in a sad heap on the ground, and buried my face in my[SEP]hands.[SEP]I could not look at her.[SEP]Fritz knelt by me, laying his hand on my[SEP]shoulder.[EOT]
[SOT]“Speak low, whatever you say,” I heard Sapt whisper as they came up; and[SEP]the next thing I heard was a low cry--half of joy, half of fear--from[SEP]the princess:[EOT]
[SOT]“It is he![SEP]Are you hurt?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]And she fell on the ground by me, and gently pulled my hands away; but I[SEP]kept my eyes to the ground.[EOT]
[SOT]“It is the King![SEP]” she said.[SEP]“Pray, Colonel Sapt, tell me where lay the[SEP]wit of the joke you played on me?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]We answered none of us; we three were silent before her.[SEP]Regardless of[SEP]them, she threw her arms round my neck and kissed me.[SEP]Then Sapt spoke in[SEP]a low hoarse whisper:[EOT]
[SOT]“It is not the King.[SEP]Don’t kiss him; he’s not the King.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She drew back for a moment; then, with an arm still round my neck, she[SEP]asked, in superb indignation:[EOT]
[SOT]“Do I not know my love?[SEP]Rudolf my love![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“It is not the King,” said old Sapt again; and a sudden sob broke from[SEP]tender-hearted Fritz.[EOT]
[SOT]It was the sob that told her no comedy was afoot.[EOT]
[SOT]“He is the King![SEP]” she cried.[SEP]“It is the King’s face--the King’s ring--my[SEP]ring![SEP]It is my love![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Your love, madame,” said old Sapt, “but not the King.[SEP]The King is there[SEP]in the Castle.[SEP]This gentleman--”[EOT]
[SOT]“Look at me, Rudolf![SEP]look at me![SEP]” she cried, taking my face between her[SEP]hands.[SEP]“Why do you let them torment me?[SEP]Tell me what it means![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Then I spoke, gazing into her eyes.[EOT]
[SOT]“God forgive me, madame![SEP]” I said.[SEP]“I am not the King![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I felt her hands clutch my cheeks.[SEP]She gazed at me as never man’s face[SEP]was scanned yet.[SEP]And I, silent again, saw wonder born, and doubt grow,[SEP]and terror spring to life as she looked.[SEP]And very gradually the grasp of[SEP]her hands slackened; she turned to Sapt, to Fritz, and back to me: then[SEP]suddenly she reeled forward and fell in my arms; and with a great cry of[SEP]pain I gathered her to me and kissed her lips.[SEP]Sapt laid his hand on my[SEP]arm.[SEP]I looked up in his face.[SEP]And I laid her softly on the ground, and[SEP]stood up, looking on her, cursing heaven that young Rupert’s sword had[SEP]spared me for this sharper pang.[EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER 21[EOT]
[SOT]If love were all![EOT]
[SOT]It was night, and I was in the cell wherein the King had lain in the[SEP]Castle of Zenda.[SEP]The great pipe that Rupert of Hentzau had nicknamed[SEP]“Jacob’s Ladder” was gone, and the lights in the room across the moat[SEP]twinkled in the darkness.[SEP]All was still; the din and clash of strife[SEP]were gone.[SEP]I had spent the day hidden in the forest, from the time when[SEP]Fritz had led me off, leaving Sapt with the princess.[SEP]Under cover of[SEP]dusk, muffled up, I had been brought to the Castle and lodged where I[SEP]now lay.[SEP]Though three men had died there--two of them by my hand--I was[SEP]not troubled by ghosts.[SEP]I had thrown myself on a pallet by the window,[SEP]and was looking out on the black water; Johann, the keeper, still pale[SEP]from his wound, but not much hurt besides, had brought me supper.[SEP]He[SEP]told me that the King was doing well, that he had seen the princess;[SEP]that she and he, Sapt and Fritz, had been long together.[SEP]Marshal[SEP]Strakencz was gone to Strelsau; Black Michael lay in his coffin, and[SEP]Antoinette de Mauban watched by him; had I not heard, from the chapel,[SEP]priests singing mass for him?[EOT]
[SOT]Outside there were strange rumours afloat.[SEP]Some said that the prisoner[SEP]of Zenda was dead; some, that he had vanished yet alive; some, that he[SEP]was a friend who had served the King well in some adventure in England;[SEP]others, that he had discovered the Duke’s plots, and had therefore been[SEP]kidnapped by him.[SEP]One or two shrewd fellows shook their heads and said[SEP]only that they would say nothing, but they had suspicions that more was[SEP]to be known than was known, if Colonel Sapt would tell all he knew.[EOT]
[SOT]Thus Johann chattered till I sent him away and lay there alone,[SEP]thinking, not of the future, but--as a man is wont to do when stirring[SEP]things have happened to him--rehearsing the events of the past weeks,[SEP]and wondering how strangely they had fallen out.[SEP]And above me, in the[SEP]stillness of the night, I heard the standards flapping against their[SEP]poles, for Black Michael’s banner hung there half-mast high, and above[SEP]it the royal flag of Ruritania, floating for one night more over my[SEP]head.[SEP]Habit grows so quick, that only by an effort did I recollect that[SEP]it floated no longer for me.[EOT]
[SOT]Presently Fritz von Tarlenheim came into the room.[SEP]I was standing then[SEP]by the window; the glass was opened, and I was idly fingering the cement[SEP]which clung to the masonry where “Jacob’s Ladder” had been.[SEP]He told me[SEP]briefly that the King wanted me, and together we crossed the drawbridge[SEP]and entered the room that had been Black Michael’s.[EOT]
[SOT]The King was lying there in bed; our doctor from Tarlenheim was in[SEP]attendance on him, and whispered to me that my visit must be brief.[SEP]The[SEP]King held out his hand and shook mine.[SEP]Fritz and the doctor withdrew to[SEP]the window.[EOT]
[SOT]I took the King’s ring from my finger and placed it on his.[EOT]
[SOT]“I have tried not to dishonour it, sire,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“I can’t talk much to you,” he said, in a weak voice.[SEP]“I have had a[SEP]great fight with Sapt and the Marshal--for we have told the Marshal[SEP]everything.[SEP]I wanted to take you to Strelsau and keep you with me, and[SEP]tell everyone of what you had done; and you would have been my best and[SEP]nearest friend, Cousin Rudolf.[SEP]But they tell me I must not, and that the[SEP]secret must be kept--if kept it can be.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“They are right, sire.[SEP]Let me go.[SEP]My work here is done.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, it is done, as no man but you could have done it.[SEP]When they see me[SEP]again, I shall have my beard on; I shall--yes, faith, I shall be wasted[SEP]with sickness.[SEP]They will not wonder that the King looks changed in face.[SEP]Cousin, I shall try to let them find him changed in nothing else.[SEP]You[SEP]have shown me how to play the King.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Sire,” said I.[SEP]“I can take no praise from you.[SEP]It is by the narrowest[SEP]grace of God that I was not a worse traitor than your brother.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He turned inquiring eyes on me; but a sick man shrinks from puzzles,[SEP]and he had no strength to question me.[SEP]His glance fell on Flavia’s[SEP]ring, which I wore.[SEP]I thought he would question me about it; but, after[SEP]fingering it idly, he let his head fall on his pillow.[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t know when I shall see you again,” he said faintly, almost[SEP]listlessly.[EOT]
[SOT]“If I can ever serve you again, sire,” I answered.[EOT]
[SOT]His eyelids closed.[SEP]Fritz came with the doctor.[SEP]I kissed the King’s[SEP]hand, and let Fritz lead me away.[SEP]I have never seen the King since.[EOT]
[SOT]Outside, Fritz turned, not to the right, back towards the drawbridge,[SEP]but to the left, and without speaking led me upstairs, through a[SEP]handsome corridor in the chateau.[EOT]
[SOT]“Where are we going?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]Looking away from me, Fritz answered:[EOT]
[SOT]“She has sent for you.[SEP]When it is over, come back to the bridge.[SEP]I’ll[SEP]wait for you there.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What does she want?[SEP]” said I, breathing quickly.[EOT]
[SOT]He shook his head.[EOT]
[SOT]“Does she know everything?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Yes, everything.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]He opened a door, and gently pushing me in, closed it behind me.[SEP]I found[SEP]myself in a drawing-room, small and richly furnished.[SEP]At first I thought[SEP]that I was alone, for the light that came from a pair of shaded candles[SEP]on the mantelpiece was very dim.[SEP]But presently I discerned a woman’s[SEP]figure standing by the window.[SEP]I knew it was the princess, and I walked[SEP]up to her, fell on one knee, and carried the hand that hung by her[SEP]side to my lips.[SEP]She neither moved nor spoke.[SEP]I rose to my feet, and,[SEP]piercing the gloom with my eager eyes, saw her pale face and the gleam[SEP]of her hair, and before I knew, I spoke softly:[EOT]
[SOT]She trembled a little, and looked round.[SEP]Then she darted to me, taking[SEP]hold of me.[EOT]
[SOT]“Don’t stand, don’t stand![SEP]No, you mustn’t![SEP]You’re hurt![SEP]Sit down--here,[SEP]here![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]She made me sit on a sofa, and put her hand on my forehead.[EOT]
[SOT]“How hot your head is,” she said, sinking on her knees by me.[SEP]Then she[SEP]laid her head against me, and I heard her murmur: “My darling, how hot[SEP]your head is![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Somehow love gives even to a dull man the knowledge of his lover’s[SEP]heart.[SEP]I had come to humble myself and pray pardon for my presumption;[SEP]but what I said now was:[EOT]
[SOT]“I love you with all my heart and soul![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]For what troubled and shamed her?[SEP]Not her love for me, but the fear that[SEP]I had counterfeited the lover as I had acted the King, and taken her[SEP]kisses with a smothered smile.[EOT]
[SOT]“With all my life and heart,” said I, as she clung to me.[SEP]“Always, from[SEP]the first moment I saw you in the Cathedral![SEP]There has been but one[SEP]woman in the world to me--and there will be no other.[SEP]But God forgive me[SEP]the wrong I’ve done you![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“They made you do it![SEP]” she said quickly; and she added, raising her head[SEP]and looking in my eyes: “It might have made no difference if I’d known[SEP]it.[SEP]It was always you, never the King![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I meant to tell you,” said I.[SEP]“I was going to on the night of the[SEP]ball in Strelsau, when Sapt interrupted me.[SEP]After that, I couldn’t--I[SEP]couldn’t risk losing you before--before--I must![SEP]My darling, for you I[SEP]nearly left the King to die![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I know, I know![SEP]What are we to do now, Rudolf?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I put my arm round her and held her up while I said:[EOT]
[SOT]“I am going away tonight.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Ah, no, no![SEP]” she cried.[SEP]“Not tonight![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I must go tonight, before more people have seen me.[SEP]And how would you[SEP]have me stay, sweetheart, except--?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“If I could come with you![SEP]” she whispered very low.[EOT]
[SOT]“My God![SEP]” said I roughly, “don’t talk about that![SEP]” and I thrust her a[SEP]little back from me.[EOT]
[SOT]“Why not?[SEP]I love you.[SEP]You are as good a gentleman as the King![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Then I was false to all that I should have held by.[SEP]For I caught her in[SEP]my arms and prayed her, in words that I will not write, to come with me,[SEP]daring all Ruritania to take her from me.[SEP]And for a while she listened,[SEP]with wondering, dazzled eyes.[SEP]But as her eyes looked on me, I grew[SEP]ashamed, and my voice died away in broken murmurs and stammerings, and[SEP]at last I was silent.[EOT]
[SOT]She drew herself away from me and stood against the wall, while I sat[SEP]on the edge of the sofa, trembling in every limb, knowing what I had[SEP]done--loathing it, obstinate not to undo it.[SEP]So we rested a long time.[EOT]
[SOT]“I am mad![SEP]” I said sullenly.[EOT]
[SOT]“I love your madness, dear,” she answered.[EOT]
[SOT]Her face was away from me, but I caught the sparkle of a tear on her[SEP]cheek.[SEP]I clutched the sofa with my hand and held myself there.[EOT]
[SOT]“Is love the only thing?[SEP]” she asked, in low, sweet tones that seemed[SEP]to bring a calm even to my wrung heart.[SEP]“If love were the only thing, I[SEP]would follow you--in rags, if need be--to the world’s end; for you hold[SEP]my heart in the hollow of your hand![SEP]But is love the only thing?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I made no answer.[SEP]It gives me shame now to think that I would not help[SEP]her.[EOT]
[SOT]She came near me and laid her hand on my shoulder.[SEP]I put my hand up and[SEP]held hers.[EOT]
[SOT]“I know people write and talk as if it were.[SEP]Perhaps, for some, Fate[SEP]lets it be.[SEP]Ah, if I were one of them![SEP]But if love had been the only[SEP]thing, you would have let the King die in his cell.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I kissed her hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“Honour binds a woman too, Rudolf.[SEP]My honour lies in being true to my[SEP]country and my House.[SEP]I don’t know why God has let me love you; but I[SEP]know that I must stay.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Still I said nothing; and she, pausing a while, then went on:[EOT]
[SOT]“Your ring will always be on my finger, your heart in my heart, the[SEP]touch of your lips on mine.[SEP]But you must go and I must stay.[SEP]Perhaps I[SEP]must do what it kills me to think of doing.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I knew what she meant, and a shiver ran through me.[SEP]But I could not[SEP]utterly fail her.[SEP]I rose and took her hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“Do what you will, or what you must,” I said.[SEP]“I think God shows His[SEP]purposes to such as you.[SEP]My part is lighter; for your ring shall be on[SEP]my finger and your heart in mine, and no touch save of your lips will[SEP]ever be on mine.[SEP]So, may God comfort you, my darling![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]There struck on our ears the sound of singing.[SEP]The priests in the chapel[SEP]were singing masses for the souls of those who lay dead.[SEP]They seemed to[SEP]chant a requiem over our buried joy, to pray forgiveness for our love[SEP]that would not die.[SEP]The soft, sweet, pitiful music rose and fell as we[SEP]stood opposite one another, her hands in mine.[EOT]
[SOT]“My queen and my beauty![SEP]” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“My lover and true knight![SEP]” she said.[SEP]“Perhaps we shall never see one[SEP]another again.[SEP]Kiss me, my dear, and go![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]I kissed her as she bade me; but at the last she clung to me, whispering[SEP]nothing but my name, and that over and over again--and again--and again;[SEP]and then I left her.[EOT]
[SOT]Rapidly I walked down to the bridge.[SEP]Sapt and Fritz were waiting for me.[SEP]Under their directions I changed my dress, and muffling my face, as I[SEP]had done more than once before, I mounted with them at the door of the[SEP]Castle, and we three rode through the night and on to the breaking day,[SEP]and found ourselves at a little roadside station just over the border[SEP]of Ruritania.[SEP]The train was not quite due, and I walked with them in a[SEP]meadow by a little brook while we waited for it.[SEP]They promised to[SEP]send me all news; they overwhelmed me with kindness--even old Sapt was[SEP]touched to gentleness, while Fritz was half unmanned.[SEP]I listened in a[SEP]kind of dream to all they said.[SEP]“Rudolf![SEP]Rudolf![SEP]Rudolf![SEP]” still rang in[SEP]my ears--a burden of sorrow and of love.[SEP]At last they saw that I could[SEP]not heed them, and we walked up and down in silence, till Fritz touched[SEP]me on the arm, and I saw, a mile or more away, the blue smoke of the[SEP]train.[SEP]Then I held out a hand to each of them.[EOT]
[SOT]“We are all but half-men this morning,” said I, smiling.[SEP]“But we have[SEP]been men, eh, Sapt and Fritz, old friends?[SEP]We have run a good course[SEP]between us.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“We have defeated traitors and set the King firm on his throne,” said[SEP]Sapt.[EOT]
[SOT]Then Fritz von Tarlenheim suddenly, before I could discern his purpose[SEP]or stay him, uncovered his head and bent as he used to do, and kissed my[SEP]hand; and as I snatched it away, he said, trying to laugh:[EOT]
[SOT]“Heaven doesn’t always make the right men kings![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Old Sapt twisted his mouth as he wrung my hand.[EOT]
[SOT]“The devil has his share in most things,” said he.[EOT]
[SOT]The people at the station looked curiously at the tall man with the[SEP]muffled face, but we took no notice of their glances.[SEP]I stood with my[SEP]two friends and waited till the train came up to us.[SEP]Then we shook hands[SEP]again, saying nothing; and both this time--and, indeed, from old Sapt[SEP]it seemed strange--bared their heads, and so stood still till the train[SEP]bore me away from their sight.[SEP]So that it was thought some great man[SEP]travelled privately for his pleasure from the little station that[SEP]morning; whereas, in truth it was only I, Rudolf Rassendyll, an English[SEP]gentleman, a cadet of a good house, but a man of no wealth nor position,[SEP]nor of much rank.[SEP]They would have been disappointed to know that.[SEP]Yet[SEP]had they known all they would have looked more curiously still.[SEP]For, be[SEP]I what I might now, I had been for three months a King, which, if not[SEP]a thing to be proud of, is at least an experience to have undergone.[SEP]Doubtless I should have thought more of it, had there not echoed through[SEP]the air, from the towers of Zenda that we were leaving far away, into[SEP]my ears and into my heart the cry of a woman’s love--“Rudolf![SEP]Rudolf![SEP]Rudolf![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Hark![SEP]I hear it now![EOT]
[SOT]CHAPTER 22[EOT]
[SOT]Present, Past--and Future?[EOT]
[SOT]The details of my return home can have but little interest.[SEP]I went[SEP]straight to the Tyrol and spent a quiet fortnight--mostly on my back,[SEP]for a severe chill developed itself; and I was also the victim of a[SEP]nervous reaction, which made me weak as a baby.[SEP]As soon as I had reached[SEP]my quarters, I sent an apparently careless postcard to my brother,[SEP]announcing my good health and prospective return.[SEP]That would serve to[SEP]satisfy the inquiries as to my whereabouts, which were probably still[SEP]vexing the Prefect of the Police of Strelsau.[SEP]I let my moustache and[SEP]imperial grow again; and as hair comes quickly on my face, they were[SEP]respectable, though not luxuriant, by the time that I landed myself in[SEP]Paris and called on my friend George Featherly.[SEP]My interview with[SEP]him was chiefly remarkable for the number of unwilling but necessary[SEP]falsehoods that I told; and I rallied him unmercifully when he told me[SEP]that he had made up his mind that I had gone in the track of Madame de[SEP]Mauban to Strelsau.[SEP]The lady, it appeared, was back in Paris, but was[SEP]living in great seclusion--a fact for which gossip found no difficulty[SEP]in accounting.[SEP]Did not all the world know of the treachery and death[SEP]of Duke Michael?[SEP]Nevertheless, George bade Bertram Bertrand be of good[SEP]cheer, “for,” said he flippantly, “a live poet is better than a dead[SEP]duke.[SEP]” Then he turned on me and asked:[EOT]
[SOT]“What have you been doing to your moustache?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“To tell the truth,” I answered, assuming a sly air, “a man now and then[SEP]has reasons for wishing to alter his appearance.[SEP]But it’s coming on very[SEP]well again.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“What?[SEP]Then I wasn’t so far out![SEP]If not the fair Antoinette, there was a[SEP]charmer?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“There is always a charmer,” said I, sententiously.[EOT]
[SOT]But George would not be satisfied till he had wormed out of me (he[SEP]took much pride in his ingenuity) an absolutely imaginary love-affair,[SEP]attended with the proper _soupçon_ of scandal, which had kept me all this[SEP]time in the peaceful regions of the Tyrol.[SEP]In return for this[SEP]narrative, George regaled me with a great deal of what he called “inside[SEP]information” (known only to diplomatists), as to the true course of[SEP]events in Ruritania, the plots and counterplots.[SEP]In his opinion, he told[SEP]me, with a significant nod, there was more to be said for Black Michael[SEP]than the public supposed; and he hinted at a well-founded suspicion that[SEP]the mysterious prisoner of Zenda, concerning whom a good many paragraphs[SEP]had appeared, was not a man at all, but (here I had much ado not to[SEP]smile) a woman disguised as a man; and that strife between the King and[SEP]his brother for this imaginary lady’s favour was at the bottom of their[SEP]quarrel.[EOT]
[SOT]“Perhaps it was Madame de Mauban herself,” I suggested.[EOT]
[SOT]“No![SEP]” said George decisively, “Antoinette de Mauban was jealous of her,[SEP]and betrayed the duke to the King for that reason.[SEP]And, to confirm what[SEP]I say, it’s well known that the Princess Flavia is now extremely cold to[SEP]the King, after having been most affectionate.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]At this point I changed the subject, and escaped from George’s[SEP]“inspired” delusions.[SEP]But if diplomatists never know anything more than[SEP]they had succeeded in finding out in this instance, they appear to me to[SEP]be somewhat expensive luxuries.[EOT]
[SOT]While in Paris I wrote to Antoinette, though I did not venture to call[SEP]upon her.[SEP]I received in return a very affecting letter, in which she[SEP]assured me that the King’s generosity and kindness, no less than her[SEP]regard for me, bound her conscience to absolute secrecy.[SEP]She expressed[SEP]the intention of settling in the country, and withdrawing herself[SEP]entirely from society.[SEP]Whether she carried out her designs, I have never[SEP]heard; but as I have not met her, or heard news of her up to this time,[SEP]it is probable that she did.[SEP]There is no doubt that she was deeply[SEP]attached to the Duke of Strelsau; and her conduct at the time of his[SEP]death proved that no knowledge of the man’s real character was enough to[SEP]root her regard for him out of her heart.[EOT]
[SOT]I had one more battle left to fight--a battle that would, I knew, be[SEP]severe, and was bound to end in my complete defeat.[SEP]Was I not back[SEP]from the Tyrol, without having made any study of its inhabitants,[SEP]institutions, scenery, fauna, flora, or other features?[SEP]Had I not simply[SEP]wasted my time in my usual frivolous, good-for-nothing way?[SEP]That was the[SEP]aspect of the matter which, I was obliged to admit, would present itself[SEP]to my sister-in-law; and against a verdict based on such evidence, I had[SEP]really no defence to offer.[SEP]It may be supposed, then, that I presented[SEP]myself in Park Lane in a shamefaced, sheepish fashion.[SEP]On the whole, my[SEP]reception was not so alarming as I had feared.[SEP]It turned out that I[SEP]had done, not what Rose wished, but--the next best thing--what she[SEP]prophesied.[SEP]She had declared that I should make no notes, record no[SEP]observations, gather no materials.[SEP]My brother, on the other hand,[SEP]had been weak enough to maintain that a serious resolve had at length[SEP]animated me.[EOT]
[SOT]When I returned empty-handed, Rose was so occupied in triumphing over[SEP]Burlesdon that she let me down quite easily, devoting the greater[SEP]part of her reproaches to my failure to advertise my friends of my[SEP]whereabouts.[EOT]
[SOT]“We’ve wasted a lot of time trying to find you,” she said.[EOT]
[SOT]“I know you have,” said I.[SEP]“Half our ambassadors have led weary lives[SEP]on my account.[SEP]George Featherly told me so.[SEP]But why should you have been[SEP]anxious?[SEP]I can take care of myself.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, it wasn’t that,” she cried scornfully, “but I wanted to tell you[SEP]about Sir Jacob Borrodaile.[SEP]You know, he’s got an Embassy--at least,[SEP]he will have in a month--and he wrote to say he hoped you would go with[SEP]him.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Where’s he going to?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“He’s going to succeed Lord Topham at Strelsau,” said she.[SEP]“You couldn’t[SEP]have a nicer place, short of Paris.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Strelsau![SEP]H’m![SEP]” said I, glancing at my brother.[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, _that_ doesn’t matter![SEP]” exclaimed Rose impatiently.[SEP]“Now, you will[SEP]go, won’t you?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t know that I care about it![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, you’re too exasperating![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And I don’t think I can go to Strelsau.[SEP]My dear Rose, would it[SEP]be--suitable?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“Oh, nobody remembers that horrid old story now.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Upon this, I took out of my pocket a portrait of the King of Ruritania.[SEP]It had been taken a month or two before he ascended the throne.[SEP]She[SEP]could not miss my point when I said, putting it into her hands:[EOT]
[SOT]“In case you’ve not seen, or not noticed, a picture of Rudolf V, there[SEP]he is.[SEP]Don’t you think they might recall the story, if I appeared at the[SEP]Court of Ruritania?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]My sister-in-law looked at the portrait, and then at me.[EOT]
[SOT]“Good gracious![SEP]” she said, and flung the photograph down on the table.[EOT]
[SOT]“What do you say, Bob?[SEP]” I asked.[EOT]
[SOT]Burlesdon got up, went to a corner of the room, and searched in a heap[SEP]of newspapers.[SEP]Presently he came back with a copy of the Illustrated[SEP]London News.[SEP]Opening the paper, he displayed a double-page engraving of[SEP]the Coronation of Rudolf V at Strelsau.[SEP]The photograph and the picture[SEP]he laid side by side.[SEP]I sat at the table fronting them; and, as I[SEP]looked, I grew absorbed.[SEP]My eye travelled from my own portrait to Sapt,[SEP]to Strakencz, to the rich robes of the Cardinal, to Black Michael’s[SEP]face, to the stately figure of the princess by his side.[SEP]Long I looked[SEP]and eagerly.[SEP]I was roused by my brother’s hand on my shoulder.[SEP]He was[SEP]gazing down at me with a puzzled expression.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s a remarkable likeness, you see,” said I.[SEP]“I really think I had[SEP]better not go to Ruritania.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]Rose, though half convinced, would not abandon her position.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s just an excuse,” she said pettishly.[SEP]“You don’t want to do[SEP]anything.[SEP]Why, you might become an ambassador![SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t think I want to be an ambassador,” said I.[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s more than you ever will be,” she retorted.[EOT]
[SOT]That is very likely true, but it is not more than I have been.[EOT]
[SOT]The idea of being an ambassador could scarcely dazzle me.[SEP]I had been a[SEP]king![EOT]
[SOT]So pretty Rose left us in dudgeon; and Burlesdon, lighting a cigarette,[SEP]looked at me still with that curious gaze.[EOT]
[SOT]“That picture in the paper--” he said.[EOT]
[SOT]“Well, what of it?[SEP]It shows that the King of Ruritania and your humble[SEP]servant are as like as two peas.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]My brother shook his head.[EOT]
[SOT]“I suppose so,” he said.[SEP]“But I should know you from the man in the[SEP]photograph.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“And not from the picture in the paper?[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“I should know the photograph from the picture: the picture’s very like[SEP]the photograph, but--”[EOT]
[SOT]“It’s more like you![SEP]” said my brother.[EOT]
[SOT]My brother is a good man and true--so that, for all that he is a married[SEP]man and mighty fond of his wife, he should know any secret of mine.[SEP]But[SEP]this secret was not mine, and I could not tell it to him.[EOT]
[SOT]“I don’t think it’s so much like me as the photograph,” said I boldly.[SEP]“But, anyhow, Bob, I won’t go to Strelsau.[SEP]”[EOT]
[SOT]“No, don’t go to Strelsau, Rudolf,” said he.[EOT]
[SOT]And whether he suspects anything, or has a glimmer of the truth, I do[SEP]not know.[SEP]If he has, he keeps it to himself, and he and I never refer to[SEP]it.[SEP]And we let Sir Jacob Borrodaile find another attaché.[EOT]
[SOT]Since all these events whose history I have set down happened I have[SEP]lived a very quiet life at a small house which I have taken in the[SEP]country.[SEP]The ordinary ambitions and aims of men in my position seem to[SEP]me dull and unattractive.[SEP]I have little fancy for the whirl of society,[SEP]and none for the jostle of politics.[SEP]Lady Burlesdon utterly despairs of[SEP]me; my neighbours think me an indolent, dreamy, unsociable fellow.[SEP]Yet[SEP]I am a young man; and sometimes I have a fancy--the superstitious would[SEP]call it a presentiment--that my part in life is not yet altogether[SEP]played; that, somehow and some day, I shall mix again in great affairs,[SEP]I shall again spin policies in a busy brain, match my wits against my[SEP]enemies’, brace my muscles to fight a good fight and strike stout blows.[SEP]Such is the tissue of my thoughts as, with gun or rod in hand, I wander[SEP]through the woods or by the side of the stream.[SEP]Whether the fancy will[SEP]be fulfilled, I cannot tell--still less whether the scene that, led by[SEP]memory, I lay for my new exploits will be the true one--for I love to[SEP]see myself once again in the crowded streets of Strelsau, or beneath the[SEP]frowning keep of the Castle of Zenda.[EOT]
[SOT]Thus led, my broodings leave the future, and turn back on the past.[SEP]Shapes rise before me in long array--the wild first revel with the King,[SEP]the rush with my brave tea-table, the night in the moat, the pursuit in[SEP]the forest: my friends and my foes, the people who learnt to love and[SEP]honour me, the desperate men who tried to kill me.[SEP]And, from amidst[SEP]these last, comes one who alone of all of them yet moves on earth,[SEP]though where I know not, yet plans (as I do not doubt) wickedness, yet[SEP]turns women’s hearts to softness and men’s to fear and hate.[SEP]Where is[SEP]young Rupert of Hentzau--the boy who came so nigh to beating me?[SEP]When[SEP]his name comes into my head, I feel my hand grip and the blood move[SEP]quicker through my veins: and the hint of Fate--the presentiment--seems[SEP]to grow stronger and more definite, and to whisper insistently in my ear[SEP]that I have yet a hand to play with young Rupert; therefore I exercise[SEP]myself in arms, and seek to put off the day when the vigour of youth[SEP]must leave me.[EOT]
[SOT]One break comes every year in my quiet life.[SEP]Then I go to Dresden, and[SEP]there I am met by my dear friend and companion, Fritz von Tarlenheim.[SEP]Last time, his pretty wife Helga came, and a lusty crowing baby with[SEP]her.[SEP]And for a week Fritz and I are together, and I hear all of what[SEP]falls out in Strelsau; and in the evenings, as we walk and smoke[SEP]together, we talk of Sapt, and of the King, and often of young Rupert;[SEP]and, as the hours grow small, at last we speak of Flavia.[SEP]For every year[SEP]Fritz carries with him to Dresden a little box; in it lies a red rose,[SEP]and round the stalk of the rose is a slip of paper with the words[SEP]written: “Rudolf--Flavia--always.[SEP]” And the like I send back by him.[SEP]That[SEP]message, and the wearing of the rings, are all that now bind me and the[SEP]Queen of Ruritania.[SEP]For--nobler, as I hold her, for the act--she has[SEP]followed where her duty to her country and her House led her, and is the[SEP]wife of the King, uniting his subjects to him by the love they bear to[SEP]her, giving peace and quiet days to thousands by her self-sacrifice.[SEP]There are moments when I dare not think of it, but there are others when[SEP]I rise in spirit to where she ever dwells; then I can thank God that I[SEP]love the noblest lady in the world, the most gracious and beautiful, and[SEP]that there was nothing in my love that made her fall short in her high[SEP]duty.[EOT]
[SOT]Shall I see her face again--the pale face and the glorious hair?[SEP]Of that[SEP]I know nothing; Fate has no hint, my heart no presentiment.[SEP]I do not[SEP]know.[SEP]In this world, perhaps--nay, it is likely--never.[SEP]And can it[SEP]be that somewhere, in a manner whereof our flesh-bound minds have no[SEP]apprehension, she and I will be together again, with nothing to come[SEP]between us, nothing to forbid our love?[SEP]That I know not, nor wiser heads[SEP]than mine.[SEP]But if it be never--if I can never hold sweet converse again[SEP]with her, or look upon her face, or know from her her love; why, then,[SEP]this side the grave, I will live as becomes the man whom she loves; and,[SEP]for the other side, I must pray a dreamless sleep.[EOT]

[SOT]The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating[SEP]charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United[SEP]States.[SEP]Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a[SEP]considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up[SEP]with these requirements.[SEP]We do not solicit donations in locations[SEP]where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.[SEP]To SEND[SEP]DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state[SEP]visit www.[SEP]gutenberg.[SEP]org/donate.[EOT]

[SOT]Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed[SEP]editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in[SEP]the U.[SEP]S. unless a copyright notice is included.[SEP]Thus, we do not[SEP]necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper[SEP]edition.[EOT]
[SOT]Most people start at our website which has the main PG search[SEP]facility: www.[SEP]gutenberg.[SEP]org.[EOT]
[SOT]This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,[SEP]including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary[SEP]Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to[SEP]subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.[EOT]
