/**
 * Cross-entropy loss function implementation for multi-class classification tasks.
 *
 * Cross-entropy loss measures the performance of a classification model whose output
 * is a probability value between 0 and 1. The loss increases as the predicted probability
 * diverges from the actual label. This implementation uses the softmax function to convert
 * raw logits to probabilities before computing the cross-entropy.
 *
 * The formula used is: L = -1/N * Î£(log(p_correct_class))
 * where N is the batch size and p_correct_class is the predicted probability for the correct class.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Applies softmax normalization to convert logits to probabilities
 * - Expects targets in one-hot encoded format
 * - Includes numerical stability through epsilon addition (1e-10)
 * - Returns average loss across the batch
 *
 * This loss function is particularly effective for:
 * - Multi-class classification problems
 * - Language modeling tasks
 * - Any scenario where outputs represent class probabilities
 *
 * @see LossFunction

     * The implementation performs the following steps:
     * 1. Applies softmax to convert logits to probabilities
     * 2. Identifies the correct class from one-hot encoded targets
     * 3. Computes negative log-likelihood of the correct class probability
     * 4. Averages the loss across all samples in the batch

     * @param targets Matrix of one-hot encoded target labels.
     *               Shape: [batch_size, num_classes] where each row contains
     *               exactly one 1.0 at the correct class index and 0.0 elsewhere
     * @return The calculated cross-entropy loss averaged across the batch.
     *         Lower values indicate better model performance.
